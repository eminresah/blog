Contingency. Multiple paths, multiple leads. Threads each holding a head, head
of mine, head of hers.

Sometimes I feel a little disgust, a drop of darkness at the center of my
forehead, leading me to the past. *The* past. The known and shared past.

Then it fades away. 

I would like to know whether she will be fired from public service or whether
she will detained. I'd guess not, I don't wish either. Though the stories I've
heard make me believe there is a probability, much higher to be discharged and
less to be arrested.

What will happen then? I don't know. I don't think she knows either. Suppose
she'd been discharged and we had a meeting to discuss the situation. What could
I say?

Nothing. I don't have anything to say to her in that case. I will already have
to be played my part, *check and mate* --or *this is the day that faces become
dark* and simply stay silent. You have drawn a path and you got the results. No
need to talk, your fate has replied.

I wonder what was she expecting. Sometimes I think about her expectations to
initiate *this war of us.* I won't be able to learn: She won't talk, she wasn't
and she can never tbe that sincere anymore. It will be like a secret. A secret
like my secret of that night, *the night of opening.*

Reason of reason: Being in multiples. Multiple ideas and multiple heads. Maybe
we all have to share an idea, an idea has to live inside our heads, they have to
devour our time --to exist, to evolve-- and they cannot live simply within a
mind. 

Why do we think we create ideas by our thoughts, rather than they live
independently of us but our minds are simply their habitus?
