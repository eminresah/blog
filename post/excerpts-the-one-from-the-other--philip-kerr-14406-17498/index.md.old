My only choice was between the disastrous and the unpalatable. A very German
choice. We both knew I had little alternative but to agree to what they wanted.

“Too much arak,” whispered Eichmann. “It’s the local drink. A sort of
aniseed-flavored grape spirit. Avoid it if you can.”

“Haganah is a Jewish militia group and intelligence service.” “You mean, they’re
a terrorist organization.”

### page 26

“The Haganah want us to supply them with guns to use against the British here in
Palestine,” he said. “If the SD continues to promote Jewish emigration from
Germany, they’re also proposing to supply us with information on British troop
and naval movements in the eastern Mediterranean.” “The Jews helping their own
persecutors?”

### page 26

“The SD has already financed several Zionist training camps in Germany. Places
where young Jews can learn the agricultural skills they will need to farm this
land. Palestinian land. A National Socialist-financed Haganah is just on
possible extension of that same policy."

I know it’s hard to believe, but they dislike the British even more than they
seem to dislike us.”

The British appointed him in 1921. Which makes him the most powerful Arab in the
country. He’s also a rabid anti-Semite who makes the Führer seem like a Jew
lover. Haj Amin has declared jihad on the Jews. Which is why the Haganah and the
Irgun would like to see him dead.

When a man keeps his jacket buttoned on a hot day, it usually means one thing.
After I had explained the situation, Golomb swore in Russian, and in an effort
to smooth things over—these men were terrorists, after all—I pointed at the bar
and offered to buy them a drink.

### page 29

“Eliahu Golomb is on the Command Council of Haganah. He’s in favor of your
government’s radical Jewish policy, since it is the belief of Haganah that this
will only increase the strength of the Jewish population in Palestine. In time,
this can only mean that Jews will outnumber Arabs, after which the country will
be ours for the taking.”

We are not accustomed to European ways. We do not want them. We wish our country
to remain just as it was before the Jews started coming here in large numbers.
We want no progress. We want no prosperity. Progress and prosperity are the
enemies of true Islam. [said Haj Amin]

They say that insanity is merely the ability to see into the future. And if we
knew now what we’ll know then, it would probably be enough to make any of us
scream. In life the trick is all about keeping the two separate for as long as
possible. THREE I had to get a denazification certificate from the Ministry of
the Interior, on Prinzregentenstrasse.

If there was anyone doing well under the American occupation it was the lawyers.
The world might end one day but there will still be lawyers to process the
documents.

### page 78

German doctors have always regarded themselves as being as important as God.
Indeed, it’s probably worse than that. God probably thinks he’s a German doctor.

Tall women are always better than short ones, especially the kind of tall women
that short men seem to favor, who really aren’t that tall, they just seem that
way.

In the future I’ve an idea that everyone will be a lawyer. They’ll have to be.”

"Five thousand marks buys an awful lot of rosaries. Hell, that’s how the Borgias
made their fortune. Everyone knows that.” Frau Warzok seemed shocked. “The
Church is not like that anymore,” she said. “No?” “I couldn’t,” she said.
“Marriage is a sacrament that is indissoluble.”

“You’re quite the philosopher, aren’t you?” she said. “For a detective.” “All
detectives are philosophers, Frau Warzok. They have to be. That way they can
recognize how much of what a client tells them they can swallow safely and how
much they can flush. Which of them is as mad as Nietzsche and which of them is
only as mad as Marx. The

They’ve removed the bronze plaque that was placed on the Führer’s cell door, of
course. But we all know exactly where it is. In the same way that a Muslim knows
