In a sense, this *Sanscrit literature* prophecy can be considered correct by the
interest in Buddhism and meditation in the Western world. But in general, it's
not that at the level of Greek literature.

I feel he was actually a bit disturbed by the *publishing* business. He'd write
a blog instead of books if he'd live today. 

When you put a price label on a book, it becomes a *business* and one cannot
tell ideals above business using business.

This elitism makes the day for the obscure philosophy but do we really
understand Schopenhauer now?

I'll do so.

This elitism was nice when I was reading Schopenhauer's works in my teen years
but after all this 20 years, I feel it's rather funny. Being *not understood*
doesn't make someone special per se. If a philosopher doesn't solve a problem or
rather doesn't show us mere mortals the *basic questions*, it's not worth
considering. 

*All interpretation requires mental resources.* This is my main idea regarding
*difficult works.* If the time and energy I spent on a work doesn't directly
benefit my thirsty soul, why should I spend time on it?

This is the prime fallacy of *Idealism.* 

An idea cannot exist without a mind and from what we know, a mind cannot exist
without the supporting physical phonemena. It may be true that mind is more than
physical effects but we don't know how such a mind exists and can think.

Therefore this sentence that ties *all to idea* is a bit too elliptical. 

### page 24

> perception; that existence and perceptibility are convertible terms.” ﻿

If we deny the *existence* of matter and consider matter as a *mere illusion*,
how can we talk about anything. 

We know *ideas* through matter, we know the world and *existence* through
matter, our language is shaped by matter and without matter we cannot utter a
single word. How can we be without matter?

At the end, it may be an illusion caused by some quantum field, though it's a
very persistent, reliable and consistent illusion. Much better than other
illusions and I'd depend on matter than some *philosophy of Asiatics.*

### page 25 

> That which knows all things and is known by none is the subject.

*The subject* has no knowledge of itself, then. 

This primary problem of knowledge assumes a complete unity of being. There may be multiple subjects, each knowing each other and these multiple subjects may be present in a single mind. 

The Idealist position is considering mind as an atomic concept, without any division or whatsoever. This is merely incorrect. Mind can be composed of multiple agents or parts, each knowing others and overall mind can know itself. 

*The subject* of Arthur seems a flaky construct. 

### page 29 

> Time is nothing more than that form of the principle of sufficient reason, and
> has no further significance.

Time has no further significance than being a form of sufficient reason?

Time is what makes the world, it's core of existence more than the matter. It
doesn't *exist* as similar to *matter* but it is there creating all *ideas.*

Time seems the most important concept we don't know, that makes all other
*invisible* ideas to happen. Giving it a secondary role makes the philosophy as
a fairy tale.
