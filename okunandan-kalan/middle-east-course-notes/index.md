19th c. Middle East
===================

Society was not composed of individuals but of groups. Governments
recognized these groups.

People defined themselves by their religious affiliation

compact minorities: maronite christians, alawis, druze in jabal druze

compact minorities located specific location and has minority identity
much more than other minorities

Millet system: Religious divisions. Millets were allowed to govern
themselves.

Only 1/3 of the christians paid the poll tax. (jizya)

sunni/shia division: not about religious dogma but politics

Official establishment of Islam: Sheikh'ul-Islam. Popular Islam: Sufism.

Social hierarchy: 1. Government (military and bureaucracy) 2. Religious
establishment 3. Remainder of those outside the government

In 19th c. government became more centralized and powerful, and
landowners became more powerful too and tensions between them and
peasants grew.

There is no reliable statistics of the mid east in 19th c. Egypt's
population was 3.5M in the beginning of 19th c. It grew 25 times today.

Ottomans in 19th c.
===================

Middle East in the 19th c. was underpopulated. Now it's overpopulated.

Famine and plague was two causes for low population

Ottoman Empire became ever more muslim and ever less Christian during
19th c.

Territorialization of Identity

Religious minories sought a territorial identity

Population of Mid East grew in 19th c. and it was no longer self
sufficient in food

Almost all of trade was with Europe

Government was minimal and was recognizing only the groups, not
individuals

European Development
====================

Europe: New medicine increased the population and new shipbuilding
increased the trade

1783: The loss of Crimea. Before that Black Sea was an Ottoman lake.

The first time Muslim subjects began to live in Christian lands for the
Ottomans.

Selim III, serious efforts of modernization

Military was the vanguard of Westernization

Revolutionary change in the military led to change in other spheres

Islam was no longer a superior culture

Napoleon's invasion of Egypt

Brought also scientific missions

Russians and French were interfering with the affairs of Christians in
Ottoman lands.

The eastern Question
====================

Åžark Meselesi

Refers to the fate of the Ottoman Empire

European powers had their interests in a weak but stable Ottoman Empire

Napoleon occupied Cairo in July 1798, but one month later British
destroyed the French fleet

After autonomy of Egypt, Muhammad Ali was also a part of the Eastern
Question

Equality before law
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Step towards territorial nationalism

Brings Secularization, because Muslims become equal among others.

longer possible to suppress Christians due to European powers'
intervention.

Eroding the authority of the ulema
