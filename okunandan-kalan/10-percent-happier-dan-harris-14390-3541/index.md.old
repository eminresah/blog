I read the book in April 2018. It tells benefits of meditations and such
practices from a once skeptic perspective. There are interviews with Eckhart
Tolle, Deepak Chopra and Dalai Lama, and Mark Epstein, whom the author likes
most (as the most sensible.) Overall it's a nice and sincere introduction to
Buddhist-living in a modern world with daily responsibilities and a highly
competitive job.

## page 4 

Once you get the hang of it, the practice can create just enough space in your
head so that when you get angry or annoyed, you are less likely to take the bait
and act on it. There’s even science to back this up—an explosion of new
research, complete with colorful MRI scans, demonstrating that meditation can
essentially rewire your brain. This science challenges the common assumption
that our levels of happiness, resilience, and kindness are set from birth. Many
of us labor under the delusion that we’re permanently stuck with all of the
difficult parts of our personalities—that we are “hot-tempered,” or “shy,” or
“sad”—and that these are fixed, immutable traits. We now know that many of the
attributes we value most are, in fact, skills, which can be trained the same way
you build your body in the gym.


## page 5

I discovered, this new neuroscience has led to the flowering of an elite
subculture of executives, athletes, and marines who are using meditation to
improve their focus, curb their addiction to technology, and stop being yanked
around by their emotions.


## page 5

If I quiet the voice in my head, will I lose my edge? Some think they need
depression to be creative or compulsive worry to be successful.


## page 14

The other running joke was that I had inherited all of my dad’s worrier genes,
and my brother had been spared. As Matt once quipped, “Dan makes Woody Allen
look like a Buddhist monk.”


## page 27

With coke, you never reach satiety. It hits, it peaks, it fades—and before you
know it, every cell in your body is screaming for more. It’s like that line from
the poet Rilke, who referred to the “quick gain of an approaching loss.” I
chased this dragon with the zeal of the convert.


## page 27

The lesson for the neophyte drug taker was that there is no free lunch,
neurologically speaking. On the day after ecstasy, my serotonin stores would be
utterly depleted. I often found myself overwhelmed by a soul-sucking sense of
emptiness, a hollowed-out husk of a man.


## page 62

Tolle began to unfurl a fascinating thesis, one that made me think he must have
somehow spent an enormous amount of time inside my skull. Our entire lives, he
argued, are governed by a voice in our heads. This voice is engaged in a
ceaseless stream of thinking—most of it negative, repetitive, and
self-referential. It squawks away at us from the minute we open our eyes in the
morning until the minute we fall asleep at night, if it allows us to sleep at
all. Talk, talk, talk: the voice is constantly judging and labeling everything
in its field of vision. 


## page 67

A New Earth, came out, Oprah put on an unprecedented, eleven-part “webinar.”
Millions of people tuned in to watch her and Tolle sit at a desk, deconstructing
the book, chapter by chapter. Their personal styles were almost comically
mismatched: Oprah would whoop and holler as Tolle looked on placidly; Tolle
would prattle on about “energy fields” as Oprah mmmed and aahed credulously.


## page 68

But then a funny thing happened. After all my reading about the empty nattering
of the ego, I realized: These fearful forecasts were just thoughts skittering
through my head. They weren’t irrational, but they weren’t necessarily true.


## page 70

How do we do a better job of staying in the Now? Tolle’s answer: “Always say
‘yes’ to the present moment.” How do we achieve liberation from the voice in the
head? His advice: simply be aware of it. “To become free of the ego is not
really a big job but a very small one.” Yes, right. Easy. But if it were this
uncomplicated, wouldn’t there be millions of awakened people walking around?


## page 72

“How on earth do you stop thinking?” I began. “How do you stop the voice in your
head?” I had a momentary surge of optimism as he shifted in his chair in clear
preparation to give the practical advice I’d been yearning for. “You create
little spaces in your daily life where you are aware but not thinking,” he said.
“For example, you take one conscious breath.”


## page 76

Was it really possible to defeat the gray Stalinism of self-absorption without
ending up on a park bench? I was not about to let this drop. It was as if I’d
met a man who’d told me my hair was on fire, and then refused to offer me a fire
extinguisher.


## page 78

Right off the bat, Chopra dismissed Tolle as “not a very good writer.”
(Apparently self-help gurus talk smack about one another, just as some
evangelicals do, I realized.)


## page 79

When you’re totally present, whatever the situation is, good or bad, it’s gonna
pass. The only thing that remains is the moment. It’s the transformational
vortex to the infinite.” Apparently when one lives in the moment, one becomes
unafraid of using terms like “transformational vortex to the infinite.”


## page 84

On many levels, Deepak seemed like a walking contradiction. He claimed to be
perennially present, and yet we filmed him pounding down the street while
furiously typing on his BlackBerry, and then voraciously devouring articles on
his Kindle while ostensibly working out on an elliptical machine.

## page 84

He claimed to live in a state of “flow” and “effortless spontaneity,” but he
seemed pretty focused on mundane self-promotion to me. While publicizing his
latest book, he lobbied a reporter to follow him on Twitter, and when shooting a
promotional video, he told the cameraman, “Make sure I don’t look fat.” These
didn’t strike me as the actions of a man living in perfect harmony with himself;
this was the type of shit I did.


## page 85

He quit his day job and went to work for the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the bearded
Indian holy man perhaps most famous for his stint as the official guru of the
Beatles. (After a brief stay at his ashram, John Lennon left in a huff over
allegations that the Maharishi had tried to fondle Mia Farrow. On his way back
to London, Lennon wrote the song “Sexy Sadie,” featuring the lyric, “What have
you done? You’ve made a fool of everyone.”) Deepak climbed to the rank of the
Maharishi’s top lieutenant.


## page 86

His memorable assertions to me included “The universe is a nanotechnology
workshop in the mind of god,” and “Don’t call it God, call it a-causal,
non-local, quantum-mechanical inter-religiousness.”


## page 86

Eckhart was befuddling because, while I believed he was sincere, I couldn’t tell
if he was sane. With Deepak it was the opposite; I believed he was sane, but I
couldn’t tell if he was sincere.


## page 88

Homeless just thirty years ago, Vitale had earned his PhD in “metaphysics”
through a correspondence course from the University of Sedona.


## page 90

Sedona, a city known as the New Age Vatican, set amid dramatic red rock cliffs,
was a mecca for spiritual tourists who were catered to by a legion of
self-proclaimed healers, mystics, wind whisperers, and intuitive counselors who
offered such services as “soul-retrieval,” “energy healing,” and “aura photos.”


## page 92

About ten years prior, she had read some books by Epstein who, she explained,
was a psychiatrist and a practicing Buddhist.


## page 93

The best parts of Tolle were largely unattributed Buddhism. Tolle had not, as
I’d assumed when I’d first read A New Earth, made up his insights out of whole
cloth.


## page 94

The word Buddhism was actually an invention of the nineteenth-century Western
scholars who discovered and translated the original texts. As best I could tell,
the whole thing appeared to be less a faith than a philosophy, and one that had
been intriguing psychologists since the days of Freud, when his early Viennese
followers studied those newly translated texts.


## page 97

If there was no such thing as security, then why bother with the insecurity?


## page 98

Wasn’t the Buddhist emphasis on “letting go” a recipe for passivity? Was the
denigration of desire another way of saying we shouldn’t bother to strive?


## page 101

It hit me that what I had on my hands here was a previously undiscovered
species: a normal human being. Epstein, it appeared to me, was the anti-Tolle,
the anti-Chopra.


## page 102

[I]t was impossible not to notice that nearly all of these names were Jewish:
Goldstein, Goleman, Kornfield, Salzberg. “This is a whole subculture,” he said.
The little cabal even had a nickname: the “Jew-Bus.”


## page 103

Mark theorized that many of these young Jewish people, having been raised in
secular environments, felt a spiritual hole in their lives. He also acknowledged
that the Jewish penchant for anxiety probably played a role in their collective
attraction to Buddhism. Over the ensuing decades, the Jew-Bus had been a major
force in figuring out how to translate the wisdom of the East for a Western
audience—mostly by making it less hierarchical and devotional.


## page 107

1. Sit comfortably. You don’t have to be cross-legged. Plop yourself in a chair,
   on a cushion, on the floor—wherever. Just make sure your spine is reasonably
   straight.

2. Feel the sensations of your breath as it goes in and out. Pick a spot:
   nostrils, chest, or gut. Focus your attention there and really try to feel
   the breath. If it helps to direct your attention, you can use a soft mental
   note, like “in” and “out.”

3. This one, according to all of the books I’d read, was the biggie. Whenever
   your attention wanders, just forgive yourself and gently come back to the
   breath. You don’t need to clear the mind of all thinking; that’s pretty much
   impossible. (True, when you are focused on the feeling of the breath, the
   chatter will momentarily cease, but this won’t last too long.) The whole game
   is to catch your mind wandering and then come back to the breath, over and
   over again.


## page 108

It didn’t get any easier. Almost immediately upon sitting down, I’d be beset by
itches. Then there was the fatigue: a thick ooze, a sludgelike torpor sliding
down my forehead. Even when the itches and fatigue lifted, I was left contending
with the unstoppable fire hose of thoughts.


## page 111

Buddhism’s secret sauce went by a hopelessly anodyne name: “mindfulness.” In a
nutshell, mindfulness is the ability to recognize what is happening in your mind
right now—anger, jealousy, sadness, the pain of a stubbed toe, whatever—without
getting carried away by it. According to the Buddha, we have three habitual
responses to everything we experience. We want it, reject it, or we zone out.
Cookies: I want. Mosquitoes: I reject. The safety instructions the flight
attendants read aloud on an airplane: I zone out. Mindfulness is a fourth
option, a way to view the contents of our mind with nonjudgmental remove. I
found this theory elegant, but utterly unfeasible.


## page 113

The Buddhists had a helpful analogy here. Picture the mind like a waterfall,
they said: the water is the torrent of thoughts and emotions; mindfulness is the
space behind the waterfall.


## page 125

This time, the debate would be between Chopra and his longtime nemesis, Michael
Shermer, a former fundamentalist Christian turned militant atheist and
professional debunker of pseudoscience.


## page 125

[S]ince Deepak didn’t believe in what he called the “dead white man” God of the
Bible, but rather in an indescribable intelligence at the heart of the universe,
a view he believed science could support.


## page 129

Silence, however, is the part that worries me the least. I don’t imagine there
will be many people at the retreat I’ll be dying to chat with. What truly scares
me is the pain and boredom of sitting and meditating all day every day for ten
straight days.


## page 133

(I’ve read that there’s such a thing as a “yogi crush,” a silent longing for one
of your fellow meditators, at whom you steal furtive glances and around whom you
construct feverish fantasies. As I look around the room, I realize this will not
be a problem for me.) 


## page 134

In the first part of the chant, we’re “taking refuge” in the Buddha, “the
Blessed One, the Perfected One, the Fully Enlightened One.” Then we take the
“precepts,” which are basically a series of promises: no harming (people or
animals), no stealing, no lying, no substance abuse—and also, as if this might
be a problem, “no dancing, singing, music, and unseemly shows.” If my friends
could see me perched on this tuffet, chanting, they would be laughing their
asses off.


## page 135

While the word yogi sounds goofy—like Yogi Berra or Yogi Bear—these people all
seem so grim. Turns out, mindfulness isn’t such a cute look. Everyone is in his
or her own world, trying very hard to stay in the moment.


## page 136

During the first period of walking meditation, I’m at a loss. I have no idea
what walking meditation even means, so I decide to just take a stroll. There are
lots of animals here: salamanders, baby deer, wild turkeys. They come right up
to you, totally unafraid. Apparently the “commitment to non-harming” memo has
reached the woodland creatures. And the humans take it very seriously. Last
night, I saw a guy in the meditation hall make a big show out of ushering a bug
out of the room on a sheet of paper rather than squashing it. The third sitting
is even more of a nightmare.


## page 140

He’s talking about a verse where the Buddha calls everything we
experience—sights, sounds, smells, etc.—the “terrible bait of the world.” “It’s
... an amazing statement,” he says. “Moment after moment, experiences are
arising, and it’s as if each one has a hook ... and we’re the fish. Do we bite?
Or do we not bite, and just swim freely in the ocean?”


## page 141

This time, it’s the metta chant, where we send “loving-kindness” to a whole
series of “beings,” including our parents, teachers, and “guardian deities.” We
wish for everyone to experience the End of Suffering.


## page 144

I get that, just like regular meditation is designed to build our mindfulness
muscle, metta is supposed to boost our capacity for compassion, but all this
exercise is doing for me is generating feelings of boredom, disdain, and
insufficiency.


## page 145

At the end of one back-and-forth, I look up and see a statue of the Buddha.
Silently, I send him the following message: Fuck you.


## page 149

I’m remembering that time when my friend Kaiama stumped me by asking how anyone
can be in the present moment when it’s always slipping away. It’s so obvious to
me now: the slipping away is the whole point. Once you’ve achieved choiceless
awareness, you see so clearly how fleeting everything is. Impermanence is no
longer theoretical. Tempus fugit isn’t just something you inscribe in books and
clocks. And that, I realize, is what this retreat is designed to do.

## page 152

The Buddha’s signature pronouncement—“Life is suffering”—is the source of a
major misunderstanding, and by extension, a major PR problem. It makes Buddhism
seem supremely dour. Turns out, though, it’s all the result of a translation
error. The Pali word dukkha doesn’t actually mean “suffering.” There’s no
perfect word in English, but it’s closer to “unsatisfying” or “stressful.” When
the Buddha coined his famous phrase, he wasn’t saying that all of life is like
being chained to a rock and having crows peck out your innards. What he really
meant was something like, “Everything in the world is ultimately unsatisfying
and unreliable because it won’t last.”


## page 153

There’s actually a term for this—“hedonic adaptation.” When good things happen,
we bake them very quickly into our baseline expectations, and yet the primordial
void goes unfilled.


## page 157

At the end, the meditator arrives at the true goal of Buddhist meditation: to
see that the “self” that we take to be the ridgepole of our lives is actually an
illusion. The real superpower of meditation is not just to manage your ego more
mindfully but to see that the ego itself has no actual substance. Close your
eyes and look for it, and you won’t find any “self” you can put your finger on.

## page 159

He urges us not to spend too much time thinking about the stuff we have to do when the retreat is over. It’s a waste of time, he says; they’re just thoughts.

## page 159

“But when you find yourself running through your trip to the airport for the
seventeenth time, perhaps ask yourself the following question: ‘Is this
useful’?”

## page 159

It’s okay to worry, plot, and plan, he’s saying—but only until it’s not useful
anymore.

## page 163

The more I meditated, the more I looked around and appreciated that we all have
monkey minds—that everyone has their own Weirs and Muirs they’re competing
against, their own manufactured balding crises (and, of course, the kinds of
more serious collisions with impermanence from which I had mercifully been
spared thus far).

## page 164

It vaguely reminded me of the middling 1990s comedy Crazy People, in which
Dudley Moore plays an ad exec who decides to start employing honesty in his
taglines, coming up with such gems as “Volvos—Yes they are boxy, but they’re
safe,” and “Jaguar—For men who’d like hand jobs from beautiful women they hardly
know.” His company sends him to an insane asylum.

## page 167

According to the school of Buddhism to which Joseph belonged (there were many,
I’d learned), there were four stages of enlightenment. The schema sounded like
something out of Dungeons & Dragons. Someone who’d achieved the first stage of
enlightenment was a “stream-enterer.” This was followed by a “once-returner,” a
“non-returner,” and then a fully enlightened being, known as an “arhant.” Each
stage had sixteen sublevels.

## page 180

My mother—the original skeptic in my life, the debunker of God and Santa
Claus—was very impressed by the Harvard study showing gray matter thickening in
meditators. After reading about it online, she asked me to give her a meditation
guidebook for Christmas. A few weeks later, she sent me an excited email saying
that she had read the book and had decided, during a taxi ride to the airport,
to give it a try.


## page 183

“It’s not me telling you,” she said. “It’s neuroscience that would say that our
capacity to multitask is virtually nonexistent. Multitasking is a
computer-derived term. We have one processor. We can’t do it.”

## page 183

Another tip: take short mindfulness breaks throughout the day. She called them
“purposeful pauses.” So, for example, instead of fidgeting or tapping your
fingers while your computer boots up, try to watch your breath for a few
minutes. When driving, turn off the radio and feel your hands on the wheel. Or
when walking between meetings, leave your phone in your pocket and just notice
the sensations of your legs moving.


## page 183

Marturano recommended something radical: do only one thing at a time. When
you’re on the phone, be on the phone. When you’re in a meeting, be there. Set
aside an hour to check your email, and then shut off your computer monitor and
focus on the task at hand.


## page 190

What I liked about the dharma was its rigorous empiricism and unyielding embrace
of hard truths.


## page 191


[Dalai Lama] “There’s a risk,” I said. “What if scientists discover something
that contradicts your faith?” “No—no risk. If a scientist confirm nonexistence
of something we believe, then we have to accept that.” “So if scientists come up
with something that contradicts your beliefs, you will change your beliefs?” “Oh
yes. Yes.” Reassuring answer.


## page 192

If someone is never lose temper then perhaps they may come from another space,”
 [Dalai Lama] said, pointing toward the sky and laughing from the belly, his
 eyes twinkling beneath his thick glasses.


## page 192

“So if somebody says to you, ‘I never lose my temper,’ you don’t believe them?”
“No. And some people say this is some miracle power—I don’t believe.” Within
minutes, he had already proven himself more reasonable than either Eckhart Tolle
or Deepak Chopra.


## page 193

“Yes. Practice of compassion is ultimately benefit to you. So I usually
describe: we are selfish, but be wise selfish rather than foolish selfish.”

## page 193

As our crew was packing up to leave, he called me back over one more time and
said that if I was really interested in Buddhism, I should read his favorite
book, by an ancient sage named Shantideva. The PR people from Emory breathlessly
told me this must mean he really liked me. Ultimately, I couldn’t get through
the book—but that notion about being nice for selfish reasons, that I kept.

## page 195

From a traditionalist standpoint, my approach to meditation—and that of most
Western practitioners—was backward. In the Buddha’s day, he first taught
generosity and morality before he gave his followers meditation instructions.
The logic was self-interested: it’s hard to concentrate if your mind is humming
with remorse over having been a shithead, or if you’re constantly scrambling to
try to keep various lies straight. In his typical OCD fashion, the Buddha even
compiled a list of the eleven benefits to practicing metta, which promised that
you’d sleep better, your face would be radiant, people and animals would love
you, celestial beings would protect you, and you’d be reborn in a happy realm.
As usual, the list lost impact for me as it edged toward the supernatural.


## page 196

Per Spring’s instruction from the retreat, I’d spend the first five or ten
minutes of my sessions picturing and sending good vibes out to: myself, a
“benefactor” (either Matt, Mark, or my parents), a “dear friend” (my favorite
cat, Steve), a “neutral person” (our overnight doorman), a “difficult person”
(not a hard category to fill), and then “all living beings” (usually a National
Geographic–style tour of the planet).


## page 196

Whatever the cause, in the months after I started adding compassion into my
meditation practice, things started to change. It’s not that I was suddenly a
saint or that I began to exhibit extra-virgin extroversion, just that being
nice—always important to me in the abstract, at least—now became a conscious,
daily priority.


## page 197

The Buddha captured it well when he said that anger, which can be so seductive
at first, has “a honeyed tip” but a “poisoned root.”


## page 198

Rather, it was simply that actions have immediate consequences in your
mind—which cannot be fooled. Behave poorly, and whether you’re fully conscious
of it or not, your mind contracts. The great blessing—and, frankly, the great
inconvenience—of becoming more mindful and compassionate was that I was
infinitely more sensitive to the mental ramifications of even the smallest
transgressions, from killing a bug to dropping trash on the street.


## page 202

There was a larger issue at play here: Was journalism—or any high-stakes,
competitive profession, really—incompatible with metta? My job required me to
ask provocative questions, to “go in for the kill,” as we say—and, often, that
wasn’t so nice.

## page 206

Sharon happened to give a very timely talk on the subject of mudita, the
Buddhist term for sympathetic joy. She admitted that sometimes her first
instinct when trying to summon this feeling was “Ew, I wish you didn’t have so
much going for you.”

## page 206

“When faced with something like this,” she said, “often it’s not the unknown
that scares us, it’s that we think we know what’s going to happen—and that it’s
going to be bad. But the truth is, we really don’t know.”


## page 208

I also thought, with a degree of self-satisfaction, that having a calmer, more
compassionate mind was allowing me to take a dry-eyed view of the situation,
unclouded by unhelpful emotion. Rather than take it personally, I tried to see
it through Ben’s eyes. He was just doing the best he could to turn the news
division around. Maybe I just wasn’t his cup of tea? I comforted myself with the
conclusion that I was engaged in a healthy acknowledgment of reality that would
ultimately allow for the virtuous cycle of less unnecessary straining and better
decision making.


## page 210

In mere minutes he had pinpointed and pronounced my errors. Behind the fig leaf
of being a good yogi, I had gone so far down the path of resignation and
passivity that I had compromised the career I had worked for decades to build.


## page 211

The Sufi Muslims say, “Praise Allah, but also tie your camel to the post.” In
other words, it’s good to take a transcendent view of the world, but don’t be a
chump.


## page 215

The upturn began one morning after the show, when Bianca found me sitting on the
living room couch, once again watching and puzzling over some on-air moments
with which I was dissatisfied. She grabbed the remote out of my hand and
spontaneously began an hour-long clinic, starting at the top of the show and
deconstructing exactly how and where I went wrong.



## page 217

“Yeah,” he said, in as snide a tone as he was capable of. “Me and your parents.”
But it’s not the same thing, he explained. You can do your best and then, if
things don’t go your way, still become unconstructively upset, in a way that
hinders your ability to bounce back. Dropping the attachment is the real trick.
Then it clicked. Per usual, Mark’s advice was sound, even if it took me a while
to absorb it. Striving is fine, as long as it’s tempered by the realization
that, in an entropic universe, the final outcome is out of your control. If you
don’t waste your energy on variables you cannot influence, you can focus much
more effectively on those you can. When you are wisely ambitious, you do
everything you can to succeed, but you are not attached to the outcome—so that
if you fail, you will be maximally resilient, able to get up, dust yourself off,
and get back in the fray. That, to use a loaded term, is enlightened
self-interest.


## page 219

Since the Buddhists are always making lists (I was convinced that somewhere they
had a list of the Best Ways to Make a List), I resolved to draw up one of my
own. Nothing on the list I compiled was, in and of itself, mind-bogglingly
brilliant. There’s a reason why they call Buddhism “advanced common sense”; it’s
all about methodically confronting obvious-but-often-overlooked truths
(everything changes, nothing fully satisfies) until something in you shifts.

## page 221

Being happier did not, as many fear, make me a blissed-out zombie. This myth
runs deep, all the way back to Aristotle, who said, “All men who have attained
excellence in philosophy, in poetry, in art and in politics ... had a
melancholic habitus.” I found that rather than rendering me boringly
problem-free, mindfulness made me, as an eminent spiritual teacher once said, “a
connoisseur of my neuroses.”


## page 222

We’re all the stars of our own movies, but cutting back on the number of Do you
know who I am? thoughts made my life infinitely smoother. When you don’t dig in
your heels and let your ego get into entrenched positions from which you mount
vigorous, often irrational defenses, you can navigate tricky situations in a
much more agile way.


## page 224

have three significant updates since the end of the last chapter. These include:
a flip-flop, a promotion, and I guess what you might call a moment of clarity.


## page 226

To make sure I wasn’t losing my mind, I called the most skeptical person I knew,
Sam Harris. Lo and behold, he, too, said enlightenment was real, although he
used a different analogy. Just as it’s possible for humans to train to be fast
or strong enough to compete in the Olympics, he argued we can practice to be the
wisest or most compassionate version of ourselves.


## page 229

When the interview got under way, I asked him, “Would you describe your work as
dangerous?” “Your job is dangerous,” he said. “What if I decided to kill or
kidnap you right now?” Awkward silence. I was 97 percent sure the don was
kidding, but the remaining 3 percent was enough to throw me into a funny
headspace. What followed was what I’m calling, for lack of a better term, a
moment of clarity. Again, nothing mystical—just a series of thoughts,
realizations, and entreaties that arose in a flash.


## page 234

1. Sit comfortably. You don’t have to twist yourself into a cross-legged
   position—unless you want to, of course. You can just sit in a chair. (You can
   also stand up or lie down, although the latter can sometimes result in an
   unintentional nap.) Whatever your position, you should keep your spine
   straight, but don’t strain. 

2. Feel your breath. Pick a spot: nose, belly, or chest. Really try to feel the
   in-breath and then the out-breath. 3. This one is the key: Every time you get
   lost in thought—which you will, thousands of times—gently return to the
   breath. I cannot stress strongly enough that forgiving yourself and starting
   over is the whole game. As my friend and meditation teacher Sharon Salzberg
   has written, “Beginning again and again is the actual practice, not a problem
   to overcome so that one day we can come to the ‘real’ meditation.”


## page 239

This is so unbelievably boring. Boredom: also not a new problem. The advice here
is similar to how you should handle pain and fatigue: investigate. What does
boredom feel like? How does it manifest in your body? Whatever comes up in your
mind can be co-opted and turned into the object of meditation. It’s like in
judo, where you use the force of your enemy against him.

## page 239

I keep trying to feel the breath as it naturally occurs, but every time I focus
on it, I involuntarily start to control it, so it feels artificial. Doesn’t
matter. As Joseph Goldstein says, “This is not a breathing exercise.” You don’t
have to breathe a certain way. If you want, you can even take sharper breaths so
that it’s easier to feel them. What matters here is the mindfulness, not the
breath.

### Body scan 

1. Sit, stand, or lie down. 

2. Start at one end of your body and work up or down. Bring your attention to
   your feet, your calves, your knees, your butt, and so on. When you get to
   your head, what can you feel? Anything? After reaching the top, work your way
   back down.

3. Every time your mind wanders, gently bring it back. 

### Walking meditation 

1. Stake out a stretch of ground roughly ten yards long. (That’s somewhat
   arbitrary—whatever length you’ve got will work.)

2. Slowly pace back and forth, noting: lift, move, place with every stride. Try
   your best to feel each component of every stride. (Don’t look at your feet,
   just look at a neutral point in the distance.)

3. Every time your mind wanders, gently bring it back. 

4. There is a temptation to denigrate walking meditation as less serious or
   rigorous than seated meditation, but this is wrong. Just because your legs
   are crossed doesn’t mean you’re meditating more effectively. As a noted
   teacher once said, “I’ve seen chickens sitting on their eggs for days on
   end.”

### Compassion meditation (aka metta) 

At first blush, most rational people find the below off-putting in the extreme. Trust me—or, better, trust the scientists—it works. 

1. This practice involves picturing a series of people and sending them good
   vibes. Start with yourself. Generate as clear a mental image as possible.

2. Repeat the following phrases: May you be happy, May you be healthy, May you
   be safe, May you live with ease. Do this slowly. Let the sentiment land. You
   are not forcing your well-wishes on anyone; you’re just offering them up,
   just as you would a cool drink. Also, success is not measured by whether you
   generate any specific emotion. As Sharon says, you don’t need to feel “a
   surge of sentimental love accompanied by chirping birds.” The point is to
   try. Every time you do, you are exercising your compassion muscle. (By the
   way, if you don’t like the phrases above, you can make up your own.)

3. After you’ve sent the phrases to yourself, move on to: a benefactor (a
   teacher, mentor, relative), a close friend (can be a pet, too), a neutral
   person (someone you see often but don’t really ever notice), a difficult
   person, and, finally, “all beings.”

### Open awareness 

1. Sit, stand, or lie down. (You can actually do open awareness while walking,
   too.)

2. Instead of simply watching the breath, try to watch everything that arises.
   Set up a spy cam in your mind and just see what is there to see. To maintain
   your focus, try noting whatever comes up: burning, hearing, itching,
   breathing, etc.

3. Every time you lose your focus, just forgive yourself and come back. (It’s
   pretty easy to get distracted doing this type of meditation, so you might
   want to use your breath as an anchor that you return to when you get
   scattered. It’s like filling up the hot-air balloon of the mind with enough
   concentration so that you can fly.)

TM involves a mantra—a word or a phrase that you repeat silently to yourself.
It’s a style of meditation that comes out of Hinduism and is focused mainly on
generating a deep sense of concentration, which can feel terrific. The practices
we’re discussing here come out of Buddhism and are focused more on developing
mindfulness. (The dividing lines aren’t so neat. You definitely build up
concentration in Buddhist meditation, and you can also develop some mindfulness
in TM.) The two schools tend to look down their noses at each other. However,
even though I’m in the Buddhist camp, I’ve done enough poking around in the TM
world to be convinced the practice has plenty of benefits.

Before he became Pope Benedict XVI, Cardinal Ratzinger specifically slammed
Buddhism as an “auto-erotic spirituality.”
