(p. 46)\n\nBy the end of fourth Islamic century [...] the picture had changed.\nA large part of the population had become Muslim. Not only the\ntownspeople, but a considerable number of the rural people had\nconverted. One reason for this may have been that Islam had become\nmore clearly defined, and the line between Muslims and non Muslims\nmore sharply drawn.

His work is not a polemic, as he himself\nmakes clear in his foreword:\n\n    This is not a book of controversy and debate, putting forward\n    the arguments of an opponent and distinguishing what is false in\n    them from what is true. It is a straightforward account, giving\n    the statements of Hindus and adding to them what the Greeks have\n    said of similar subjects, so as to make a comparison between\n    them.\n\nIndian religious and philosophical though is depicted at its best.\n\n    Since we are describing what there is in India, we mention their\n    superstitions, but we should point out that these are matter for\n    the common people only. Those who follow the way of salvation or\n    the path of reason and argument, and who want the truth, would\n    avoid worshipping anyone except God alone, or any graven image\n    of him. [...] The Indians in our time make numerous distinctions\n    among human beings. We differ from them in this, for we regard\n    all men as equal except in piety. This is the greatest barrier\n    between them and Islam. (p. 54)\n\n[Sunnis] came to accept all four of the first caliphs asn\nlegitimate, and as virtuous or rightly guided (*rashidun*); later\ncaliphs might not always have acted justly, but they should be\naccepted as legitimate so long as they did not go against the basic\ncommandments of God. [...] It was widely accepted that [caliph]\nshould be descended from the tribe of Quraysh, to which the Prophet\nhad belonged.
