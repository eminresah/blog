The necessarily open nature of science (notwithstanding the secret
work carried out in the Cold War and in some commercial laboratories)
ensures that there can only ever be a democracy of intellect in this,
perhaps the most important of human activities. (p. 16)

------

To succeed, to progress, the world must be open, endlessly
modifiable, unprejudiced. Science thus has a moral authority as well
as an intellectual authority. This is not always accepted. (p. 16)

------

Technology addresses specific issues and provides the individual with
greater control and/or freedom in some particular aspect of life (the
mobile phone, the portable computer, the contraceptive pill). Not
everyone will find ‘the gadget’ a suitably philosophical response to
the great dilemmas of alienation, or ennui. I contend that it
is. (p. 16)

------

Without tradition, originality cannot exist: for it is only against a
tradition that it becomes perceivable.’ (p. 17)

------

[W]hat Walter Pater in the nineteenth century called ‘the wounds of
experience’; that in order to know what is new, you need to know what
has gone before. (p. 17)

------

The fragmentation of the arts and humanities in the twentieth century
has often revealed itself as an obsession with novelty for its own
sake, rather than originality that expands on what we already know
and accept. (p. 17)

------

[I]n Max Planck’s family in Germany at the turn of the century the
humanities were regarded as a superior form of knowledge (and the
Plancks were not atypical). Is that true any longer? The arts and
humanities have always reflected the society they are part of, but
over the last one hundred years, they have spoken with less and less
confidence.9 (p. 18)

------

Very self-confident as a young man, he once quipped that ‘the good
impression of my tailor matters to me as much as that of my
professor.’ (p. 23)

------

The Viennese aristocracy had intermarried so many times that they
were in fact one huge family, who addressed each other as Du, and by
nicknames, and spent their time at each others’ parties. (p. 24)

------

Always sensitive to the slightest hint of anti-Semitism, to the end
of his life Freud refused to accept royalties from any of his works
translated into Hebrew or Yiddish. (p. 25)

------

Freud rightly considered The Interpretation of Dreams to be his most
significant achievement. It is in this book that the four fundamental
building blocks of Freud’s theory about human nature first come
together: the unconscious, repression, infantile sexuality (leading
to the Oedipus complex), and the tripartite division of the mind into
ego, the sense of self; superego, broadly speaking, the conscience;
and id, the primal biological expression of the unconscious. (p. 25)

------

When Breuer saw her, he found that if he allowed her to talk at great
length about her symptoms, they would disappear. (p. 26)

------

[T]he German title of the book, Die Traumdeutung, didn’t exactly
help. ‘Traumdeutung’ was the word used at the time to describe the
popular practice of fairground fortune-tellers.19 (p. 28)

------

Evans also found that large town houses were not confined to royalty
only but were inhabited by other citizens as well. For many scholars,
this extension of property, art, and wealth in general marked the
Minoan culture as the birth of Western civilisation, the ‘mother
culture’ from which the classical world of Greece and Rome had
evolved. (p. 33)

------

This enabled Mendel to make the profound observation that for many
characteristics, the heritable quality existed in only two forms, the
dominant and recessive strains, with no intermediate form. The
universality of the 3:1 ratio across a number of characteristics
confirmed this.* (p. 37)

------

[S]cience was Planck’s calling; he never doubted it or looked
elsewhere, and by the turn of the century he was near the top of his
profession, a member of the Prussian Academy and a full professor at
the University of Berlin, where he was known as a prolific generator
of ideas that didn’t always work out. (p. 38)

------

This was crucial because it implied that the universe was a one-way
process; the Second Law of Thermodynamics is, in effect, a
mathematical expression of time. In turn this meant that the
Newton/Maxwellian notion of atoms as hard, solid billiard balls had
to be wrong, for the implication of that system was that the ‘balls’
could run either way – under that system time was reversible; no
allowance was made for entropy. (p. 41)

------

[L]ampblack, for instance, absorbs 98 percent of all radiation. (p. 41)

------

7 October 1900. On that day he sent a postcard to his colleague
Heinrich Rubens on which he had sketched an equation to explain the
behaviour of radiation in a black body. The essence of Planck’s
idea, mathematical only to begin with, was that electromagnetic
radiation was not continuous, as people thought, but could only be
emitted in packets of a definite size. (p. 42)

------

Whatever the truth of that, by 1900 they had evolved into informal
clubs, well furnished and spacious, where the purchase of a small cup
of coffee carried with it the right to remain there for the rest of
the day and to have delivered, every half-hour, a glass of water on a
silver tray. (p. 49)

------

Universalism, on the other hand, ‘posits eternal, extramental truth,
whose validity defies testing…. (p. 49)

------

An individualist discovers truth, whereas a universalist undergoes
it. (p. 49)

------

Schnitzler’s interest in what Freud called the ‘underestimated and
much maligned erotic’ was so similar to his own that Freud referred to
Schnitzler as his doppelgänger (double) and deliberately avoided
him. (p. 51)

------

For Hofmannsthal, the problem is that while art may offer fulfilment
for the person who creates beauty, it doesn’t necessarily do so for
the mass of society who are unable to create: (p. 52)

------

What he hoped for was a ‘genius … marked with the stigma of the
usurper,’ ‘a true German and absolute man,’ ‘a prophet,’ ‘poet,’
‘teacher,’ ‘seducer,’ an ‘erotic dreamer.’ (p. 55)

------

His science led him to conclude, after twenty years of search and
lecturing, that there does indeed exist ‘an eternal, creating, and
sustaining principle,’ to which he gave the term ‘understanding.’ At
the same time, his view that philosophy moved in cycles led him to
doubt the progressivism of science. (p. 56)

------

What most concerned Husserl was the link between consciousness and
logic. Put simply, the basic question for him was this: did logic
exist objectively, ‘out there’ in the world, or was it in some
fundamental sense dependent on the mind? (p. 56)

------

Husserl made big claims for himself; in the Brentano halfway house
tradition, he believed he had worked out ‘a theoretical science
independent of all psychology and factual science.’ Few in the
Anglophone world would agree, or even understand how you could have a
theoretical science independent of factual science. (p. 58)

------

According to Weininger, all the major achievements in history arose
because of the masculine principle – all art, literature, and systems
of law, for example. The feminine principle, on the other hand,
accounted for the negative elements, and all these negative elements
converge, Weininger says, in the Jewish race. (p. 60)

------

Nietzsche’s main idea (not that he was particularly systematic) was
that all of history was a metaphysical struggle between two groups,
those who express the ‘will to power,’ the vital life force necessary
for the creation of values, on which civilisation is based, and those
who do not, primarily the masses produced by democracy. (p. 70)

------

Morality, on the other hand, ‘is the creation of the underclass.’ It
springs from resentment and nourishes the virtues of the herd
animal. (p. 71)

------

The acceptance of Nietzsche’s views was hardly helped by the fact that
many of them were written when he was already ill with the early
stages of syphilis. (p. 71)

------

Sumner believed that Darwin’s new way of looking at mankind had
provided the ultimate explanation – and rationalisation – for the
world as it was. It explained laissez-faire economics, the free,
unfettered competition popular among businessmen. Others believed
that it explained the prevailing imperial structure of the world in
which the ‘fit’ white races were placed ‘naturally’ above the
‘degenerate’ races of other colours. (p. 72)

------

It was Spencer, and not Darwin, who actually coined the phrase
‘survival of the fittest,’ and Spencer quickly saw how Darwinism
might be applied to human societies. His (p. 73)

------

Lapouge regarded democracy as a disaster and believed that the
brachycephalic types were taking over the world. He thought the
proportion of dolichocephalic individuals was declining in Europe,
due to emigration to the United States, and suggested that alcohol be
provided free of charge in the hope that the worst types might kill
each other off in their excesses. He wasn’t joking. (p. 75)

------

Everywhere he looked, there was decline. The impressionist painters
were the result, he said, of a degenerate physiology, nystagmus, a
trembling of the eyeball, causing them to paint in the fuzzy,
indistinct way that they did. (p. 76)

------

Orthodox Jews condemned him as an heretic (because he plainly wasn’t
the Messiah), but at his death, ten years and six congresses later,
the Jewish Colonial Trust, the joint stock company he had helped
initiate and which would be the backbone of any new state, had 135,000
shareholders, more than any other enterprise then existing. His
funeral was attended by 10,000 Jews from all over Europe. A Jewish
homeland had not yet been achieved, but the idea was no longer a
heresy. (p. 80)

------

For Weber, capitalism, whatever it has become, was originally sparked
by religious fervour, and without that fervour the organisation of
labour that made capitalism so different from what had gone before
would not have been possible. (p. 84)

------

Strauss therefore changed his mind, and Elektro turned out to be even
more intense, violent, and concentrated than Salomé. ‘These two operas
stand alone in my life’s work,’ said Strauss later; ‘in them I went to
the utmost limits of harmony, psychological polyphony (Clytemnestra’s
dream) and the capacity of today’s ears to take in what they hear.’ (p. 96)

------

No less than Strauss’s women, Pablo Picasso’s Les Demoiselles
d’Avignon was an attack on all previous ideas of art, self-consciously
shocking, crude but compelling. (p. 106)

------

In Paris, both Robert Delaunay and František Kupka, a Czech
cartoonist who had dropped out of the Vienna art school, made
pictures without objects. (p. 112)

------

Kandinsky did not paint his first picture until he was thirty (p. 114)

------

Delicate, with a high forehead, he spoke very slowly, with long
breaths between utterances. This was slightly off-putting, and at the
Lycée Condorcet, his high school in Paris, he came across as so
reserved that his fellow students felt ‘he had no soul,’ a telling
irony in view of his later theories. (p. 116)

------

Bergson’s own central insight was that time is real. Hardly original
or provocative, but the excitement lay in the details. What drew
people’s attention was his claim that the future does not in any sense
exist. (p. 117)

------

By definition, he said, time, as we normally understand it, involves
memory; physics-time, on the other hand, consists of ‘one long strip
of nearly identical segments,’ where segments of the past perish
almost instantaneously. (p. 117)

------

His final point, the one people found most difficult to accept, was
that since memory is necessary for time, then time itself must to some
extent be psychological. (This is what the Holy Office most objected
to, since it was an interference in God’s domain.) From this it
followed for Bergson that the evolution of the universe, insofar as it
can be known, is itself a psychological process also. (p. 117)

------

For the rationalists, Bergson’s philosophy was a sign of degeneration,
an atavistic congeries of opinions in which the rigours of science
were replaced by quasi-mystical ramblings. Paradoxically, he came
under fire from the church on the grounds that he paid too much
attention to science. (p. 119)

------

Elan vital, the ‘life force,’ turned into a widely used cliché, but
‘life’ meant not only life but intuition, instinct, the very opposite
of reason. As a result, religious and metaphysical mysteries, which
science had seemingly killed off, reappeared in ‘respectable’
guise. William James, who had himself written a book on religion,
thought that Bergson had ‘killed intellectualism definitively and
without hope of recovery. (p. 119)

------

Bergson died in 1941 of pneumonia contracted from having stood for
hours in line with other Jews, forced to register with the
authorities, then under Nazi military occupation. (p. 120)

------

Third, there was the philosophy of Immanuel Kant (1724—1804), who
argued that there were limits to reason, that human observations of
the world were ‘never neutral, never free of priorly imposed
conceptual judgements’, and because of that one could never know that
God exists. And finally there were the theories of Henri Bergson. As
we have seen, he actually supported spiritual notions, but these were
very different from the traditional teachings of the church and
closely interwoven with science and reason. (p. 121)

------

It didn’t work out like that. The new – modern, Japanese, and Western
science-oriented – curriculum proved so strange and so difficult for
the Chinese that most students stuck to the easier, more familiar
Confucianism, despite the evidence everywhere that it wasn’t working
or didn’t meet China’s needs. (p. 126)

------

[T]here was one college in Beirut and in Turkey – still a major power
until World War I – the University of Istanbul was founded in 1871 as
the Dar-al-funoun (House of Learning), only to be soon closed and not
reopened until 1900. (p. 128)

------

Until the twentieth century, however, America’s institutions of higher
learning were really colleges – devoted to teaching – rather than
universities proper, concerned with the advancement of knowledge. Only
Johns Hopkins in Baltimore (founded in 1876) and Clark (1888) came
into this category, and both were soon forced to add undergraduate
schools. (p. 129)

------

The preeminence of German universities in the late nineteenth century
dated back to the Battle of Jena in 1806, after which Napoleon finally
reached Berlin. His arrival there forced the inflexible Prussians to
change. Intellectually, Johann Fichte, Christian Wolff, and Immanuel
Kant were the significant figures, freeing German scholarship from its
stultifying reliance on theology. (p. 130)

------

Chicago was first, building seven dormitories by 1900 ‘in spite of the
prejudice against them at the time in the [mid-] West on the ground
that they were medieval, British and autocratic.’ Yale and Princeton
soon adopted a similar approach. Harvard reorganised after the English
housing model in the 1920s. (p. 131)

------

What James added to Peirce’s ideas was the notion that philosophy
should be accessible to everyone; it was a fact of life, he thought,
that everyone liked to have what they called a philosophy, a way of
seeing and understanding the world, and his lectures (eight of them)
were intended to help. (p. 132)

------

In the opposite camp were those philosophers who started from the
world as it was, with all its untidiness, inequalities, and
injustices. James was firmly in the latter camp. (p. 132)

------

Metaphysics, which James regarded as primitive, was too attached to
the big words – ‘God,’ ‘Matter,’ ‘the Absolute.’ But these, he said,
were only worth dwelling on insofar as they had what he called
‘practical cash value.’ What difference did they make to the conduct
of life? Whatever it is that makes a practical difference to the way
we lead our lives, James was prepared to call ‘truth.’ (p. 134)

------

[I]f you take away consciousness, is it practical to hang on to
‘soul’?  Can a soul be said to exist without consciousness? No, he
said. Therefore, why bother to concern oneself with (p. 134)

------

[B]efore the victory over a heavy rate of child mortality, when
families were much larger and many children died, there was not –
there could not be – the same investment in children, in time, in
education, in emotion, as there was later. (p. 135)

------

Hofstadter wisely points out that Christianity in many parts of the
United States is entirely practical in nature. He takes as his text a
quote of theologian Reinhald Niebuhr, that a strain in American
theology ‘tends to define religion in terms of adjustment to divine
reality for the sake of gaining power rather than in terms of
revelation which subjects the recipient to the criticism of that which
is revealed.’ And he also emphasises how many theological movements
use ‘spiritual technology’ to achieve their ends: ‘One … writer tells
us that … “the body is … a receiving set for the catching of messages
from the Broadcasting Station of God” and that “the greatest of
Engineers … is your silent partner.” (p. 140)

------

The telegraph operator is attacked and tied up, the robbery takes
place, and the bandits escape. At intervals, however, the operator is
shown struggling free and summoning law enforcement. Later in the film
the two narratives come together as the posse chase after the
bandits. We take such ‘parallel editing’ – intercutting between
related narratives – for granted now. At the time, however, people
were fascinated as to whether film could throw light on the stream of
consciousness, Bergson’s notions of time, or Husserl’s
phenomenology. (p. 153)

------


It was also responsible for Adolph Zukor and Marcus Loew leaving their
fur business and buying small theatres exclusively dedicated to
showing movies. Because they generally charged a nickel for entry,
they became known as ‘nickelodeons.’ (p. 153)

------


There was no such thing as a makeup assistant, and actors wore their
own clothes (though by 1909 there had been some experimentation with
lighting techniques). A director might make two or three pictures a
week, usually on location in New York. In 1909, for example, Griffith
made 142 pictures. (p. 155)

------

This was the first of Rutherford’s many important experiments: what he
and Soddy had discovered was the spontaneous decomposition of the
radioactive elements, a modern form of alchemy. (p. 160)

------

J. J. Thomson’s notion that it was a miniature plum pudding, with
electrons dotted about like raisins – would no longer do. Gradually he
became convinced that another model entirely was far more likely. He
made an analogy with the heavens: the nucleus of the atom was orbited
by electrons just as planets went round the stars. (p. 162)

------

In fact, the family legend was exaggerated. Research into Einstein’s
early life shows that at school he always came top, or next to top, in
both mathematics and Latin. But he did find enjoyment in his own
company and developed a particular fascination with his building
blocks. When he was five, his father gave him a compass. This so
excited him, he said, that he ‘trembled and grew cold.’ (p. 164)

------

Albert, for instance, was only three or four when he was given the
responsibility of running errands, alone in the busy streets of
Munich.17 (p. 164)

------

More important, the fact that he was out of the mainstream of science
may have helped his originality, which flourished unexpectedly
in 1905. (p. 165)

------

He once wrote that ‘the search for knowledge, unbearable pity for
suffering and a longing for love’ were the three passions that had
governed his life. ‘I have found it worth living,’ he concluded, ‘and
would gladly live it again if the chance were offered me.’ (p. 173)

------

‘I like mathematics,’ he wrote, ‘because it is not human & has nothing
particular to do with this planet or with the whole accidental
universe – because, like Spinoza’s God, it won’t love us in return.’
He called Leibniz and Spinoza his ‘ancestors.’ (p. 174)

------

I used to stand on the footbridge at Kennington, near Oxford, watching
the trains go by, and determining that tomorrow I would place myself
under one of them. But when the morrow came I always found myself
hoping that perhaps “Principia Mathematica” would be finished some
day.’ (p. 178)

------

There are two ways of knowing the world, Russell said: acquaintance
(spoons) and description (the class of spoons), a sort of secondhand
knowledge. From this, it follows that a description about a
description is of a higher order than the description it is about. On
this analysis, the paradox simply disappears. (p. 178)

------

The press agreed to meet 50 percent of the loss, but said they could
publish the book only if the Royal Society put up the other £300. In
the event, the Royal Society agreed to only £200, and so Russell and
Whitehead between them provided the balance. ‘We thus earned minus £50
each by ten years’ work,’ Russell commented. ‘This beats “Paradise
Lost.” (p. 179)

------

‘I used to know of only six people who had read the later parts of the
book,’ Russell wrote in the 1950s. ‘Three of these were Poles,
subsequently (I believe) liquidated by Hitler. The other three were
Texans, subsequently successfully assimilated.’ (p. 179)

------

‘[S]avage trinity’ of diseases that disfigured the developed world:
tuberculosis, alcoholism, and syphilis, all of which proved
intractable to treatment for many years. (p. 182)

------

Victorian medical ethics that prevented doctors from telling one
fiancée anything about the other’s infections unless the sufferer
allowed it. On top of it all, no one knew whether syphilis was
hereditary or congenital. (p. 183)

------

Difficult as it was to study, because it was so small, the spirochaete
was clearly the syphilis microbe, and it was labelled Treponema (it
resembled a twisted thread) pallidum (a reference to its pale
colour). (p. 184)

------

As a result of syphilis, as we have seen, the fear and guilt
surrounding illicit sex was much greater at the beginning of the
century than it is now, and helped account for the climate in which
Freudianism could grow and thrive. (p. 187)

------

The chronic fear of syphilis in those who didn’t have it, and the
chronic guilt in those who did, created in the turn-of-the-century
Western world a psychological landscape ready to spawn what came to be
called depth psychology. (p. 187)

------

The self-sufficiency of science, the self-absorption of scientists,
the sheer difficulty of so much science, made it inaccessible in a way
that the arts weren’t. (p. 188)

------

(The railroads were a sensitive area at the time. Some southern states
had ‘Jim Crow’ carriages: as the trains crossed the state line,
arriving from the North, blacks were forced to move from interracial
carriages to the blacks-only variety.) (p. 189)

------

Following the American Civil War, the Reconstruction movement had
taken hold in the South, intent on turning back the clock, rebuilding
the former Confederate states with de facto, if not de jure,
segregation. (p. 191)

------

Even as late as the turn of the century, several states were still
trying to disenfranchise blacks, and even in the North many whites
treated blacks as an inferior people. Far from advancing since the
Civil War, the fortunes of blacks had actually regressed. (p. 191)

------

Booker T. Washington. He took the view that the best form of race
relations was accommodation with the whites, accepting that change
would come eventually, and that any other approach risked a white
backlash. Washington therefore spread the notion that blacks ‘should
be a labour force, not a political force,’ and it was on this basis
that his Tuskegee Institute was founded, in Alabama, near Montgomery,
its aim being to train blacks in the industrial skills mainly needed
on southern farms. (p. 191)

------

Du Bois became convinced that Booker T. Washington’s approach actually
did more harm than good. (p. 193)

------

Frenchman Charles Richet, who in his book Sélection humaine (1912)
openly argued for all newborn infants with hereditary defects to be
killed. After infancy Richet thought castration was the best policy
but, giving way to horrified public opinion, he advocated instead the
prevention of marriage between people suffering from a whole range of
‘defects’ – tuberculosis, rickets, epilepsy, syphilis (he obviously
hadn’t heard of Salvarsen), ‘individuals who were too short or too
weak,’ criminals, and ‘people who were unable to read, write or
count.’ (p. 197)

------

Leonard Darwin, Charles Darwin’s son and from 1911 to 1928 president
of the British Eugenics Education Society, didn’t go quite this far,
but he advocated that ‘superior’ people should be encouraged to breed
more and ‘inferior’ people encouraged to reproduce less. In America,
eugenics remained a strong social movement until the 1920s, the
Indiana sterilisation laws not being repealed until 1931. In Britain
the Eugenics Education Society remained in business until the
1920s. (p. 198)

------

Despite Boas’s contribution, the Dillingham Commission Report –
eighteen volumes of it – concluded that immigrants from Mediterranean
regions were ‘biologically inferior’ to other immigrants. (p. 203)

------

He dismissed the idea that because some languages did not have
numerals above ten, as was true of certain native American tribes,
this did not mean that members of those tribes could not count above
ten in English once they had been taught to speak it. (p. 205)

------

The very strangeness of the Incas, the brilliance of their art and
buildings, the fantastic achievement of their road network, stretching
over 19,000 miles and superior in some ways to the European roads of
the same period, showed the flaws in the glib certainties of race
biology. (p. 212)

------

The phrase used by nineteenth-century scientists was ‘land bridges,’
convenient devices that were believed to stretch across the waters to
link, for example, Africa to South America, or Europe to North
America. But if these land bridges had never existed, where had they
gone to? (p. 214)

------

In 1650, James Ussher, archbishop of Armagh in Ireland, using the
genealogies given in the Bible, had calculated that the earth was
created at 9:00 A.M. on 26 October 4004 B.C. (p. 216)

------

The oldest substances on earth, to date, are some zircon crystals from
Australia dated in 1983 to 4.2 billion years old; the current best
estimate of the age of the earth is 4.5 billion years. (p. 216)

------

In some geology departments in modern universities, the twenty-sixth
of October is still celebrated - ironically - as the earth’s
birthday. (p. 218)

------

Le Sacre is not mere folk lore: it is a powerful legend about the
sacrifice of virgins in ancient Russia. In the main scene the Chosen
Virgin must dance herself to death, propelled by a terrible but
irresistible rhythm. It was this that gave the ballet a primitive,
archetypal quality. Like Debussy’s Après-midi, it related back to the
passions aroused by primitivism – blood history, sexuality, and the
unconscious. (p. 227)

------

Bohr’s quiet, agreeable, reflective personality – when speaking he
often paused for minutes on end while he sought the correct word – was
an important factor in this process. (p. 234)

------

Proust once described his multivolume work in an interview as ‘a
series of novels of the unconscious’. But not in a Freudian sense
(there is no evidence that Proust ever read Freud, whose works were
not translated into French until the novelist was near the end of his
life). Proust ‘realised’ one idea to wonderful heights. (p. 238)

------

Proust did not find it easy to publish his book. It was turned down by
a number of publishers, including the writer André Gide at Nouvelle
Revue Française, who thought Proust a snob and a literary
amateur. (p. 240)

------

Jung thought that the libido was not, as Freud insisted, solely a
sexual instinct but more a matter of ‘psychic energy’ as a whole, a
reconceptualisation that, among other things, vitiated the entire idea
of childhood sexuality, not to mention the Oedipal relationship.
Second, and perhaps even more important, Jung argued that he had
discovered the existence of the unconscious for himself, entirely
independently of Freud. (p. 241)

------

The principle is simple: the patient is shown a list of words and
asked to respond to each one with the first word that comes into
his/her head. The rationale is that in this way conscious control over
the unconscious urges is weakened. (p. 242)

------

For Jung, however, sex was not fundamental – instead, it was itself a
transformation from religion. Sex, for Jung, was one aspect of the
religious impulse but not the only one. (p. 243)

------

Jung said, by three pieces of ‘evidence.’ First, he pointed to the
‘extraordinary unanimity’ of narratives and themes in the mythologies
of different cultures. He also argued that ‘in protracted analyses,
any particular symbol might recur with disconcerting persistency but
as analysis proceeded the symbol came to resemble the universal
symbols seen in myths and legends.’ Finally he claimed that the
stories told in the delusions of mentally ill patients often resembled
those in mythology. (p. 244)

------

Freud, while troubled by this personal rift, which also had
anti-Semitic overtones, was more concerned that Jung’s version of
psychoanalysis was threatening its status as a science. Jung’s concept
of the collective unconscious, for example, clearly implied the
inheritance of acquired characteristics, which had been discredited by
Darwinism for some years. As Ronald Clark commented: ‘In short, for
the Freudian theory, which is hard enough to test but has some degree
of support, Jung [had] substituted an untestable system which flies in
the face of current genetics.’ (p. 245)

------

He notes that the toll on human life even at the beginning of the war
was so horrific that the height requirement for the British army was
swiftly reduced from five feet eight in August 1914 to five feet five
on 11 October. By November, after thirty thousand casualties in
October, men had to be only five feet three to get in. (p. 250)

------

Lack of imagination was only one cause of the disaster. It may be too
much to lay the blame on social Darwinist thinking, but the British
General Staff did hold the view that the new conscripts were a low
form of life (mainly from the Midlands), too simple and too animal to
obey any but the most obvious instructions. (p. 252)

------

That is one reason why the attack was carried out in daylight and in a
straight line, the staff feeling the men would be confused if they had
to attack at night, or by zigzagging from cover to cover. (p. 252)

------

Those who weren’t killed by gun- or shell-fire died either from cold
or literally drowned in the mud. British losses numbered
370,000. Throughout the war, some 7,000 officers and men were killed
or wounded every day: this was called ‘wastage.’ (p. 252)

------

By the end of the war, half the British army was aged less than
nineteen. No wonder people talked about a ‘lost generation.’ (p. 252)

------

Before 1914, blood transfusion was virtually unknown. By the end of
hostilities, it was almost routine. (p. 253)

------

William Harvey had discovered the circulation of the blood in 1616,
but it was not until 1907 that a doctor in Prague, Jan Jansky, showed
that all human blood could be divided into four groups, O, A, B, and
AB, distributed among European populations in fairly stable
proportions. (p. 254)

------

Binet was very practical, and he did not invest his tests with any
mystical powers. In fact, he went so far as to say that it didn’t
matter what the tests were, so long as there were a lot of them and
they were as different from one another as could be. (p. 255)

------

Accordingly, in 1912 the German psychologist W. Stern suggested that
mental age should be divided by chronological age, a calculation that
produced the intelligence quotient. (p. 256)

------

An ‘idiot’ was someone who could not master full speech, so had
difficulty following instructions, and was judged to have a mental age
of not more than three. An ‘imbecile,’ meanwhile, was someone who
could not master written language and was considered to have a mental
age somewhere between three and seven. Goddard’s first innovation was
to coin a new term – ‘moron,’ from the Greek, meaning foolish – to
denote the feebleminded individuals who were just below normal
intelligence. Between 1912 and the outbreak of war Goddard carried out
a number of experiments in which he concluded, alarmingly – or
absurdly – that between 50 and 80 percent of ordinary Americans had
mental ages (p. 256)

------

On the other hand, for Goddard, morons could never be leaders or even
really think for themselves; they were workers, drones who had to be
told what to do. (p. 257)

------

[I]mmigrants then arriving at Ellis Island, he managed to show to his
own satisfaction (and again, alarm) that as many as four-fifths of
Hungarians, Italians, and Russians were ‘moronic.’ (p. 257)

------

The first was that the average mental age of recruits was
thirteen. This sounds pretty surprising to us at this end of the
century: a nation could scarcely hope to survive in the modern world
if its average mental age really was thirteen. (p. 259)

------

There had been cases of men breaking down in earlier wars, but their
numbers had been far fewer than those with physical injuries. What
seemed to be crucially different this time was the character of
hostilities – static trench warfare with heavy bombardment, and vast
conscript armies which contained large numbers of men unsuited for
war. Psychiatrists quickly realised that in the huge civilian armies
of World War I there were many men who would not normally have become
soldiers, who were unfit for the strain, and that their ‘civilian’
neuroses would express themselves under the terror of
bombardment. (p. 261)

------

An analysis of 1,043,653 British casualties revealed that neuroses
accounted for 34 percent. (p. 261)

------

To quote Francis Hope, ‘In a not altogether rhetorical sense, all
poetry written since 1918 is war poetry.’ (p. 263)

------

Wittgenstein enlisted on 7 August, the day after the Austrian
declaration of war on Russia, and was assigned to an artillery
regiment serving at Kraków on the eastern front. He later suggested
that he went to war in a romantic mood, saying that he felt the
experience of facing death would, in some indefinable manner, improve
him (Rupert Brooke said much the same). On the first sight of the
opposing forces, he confided in a letter, ‘Now I have the chance to be
a decent human being, for I am standing eye to eye with death.’
(p. 272)

------

Nicknamed ‘Witter-Gitter,’ he was generally considered dull, with a
laboured Germanic sense of humour. (p. 274)

------

[H]e was an autodidact and didn’t care what people thought of him. (p. 275)

------

Early on in the war he conceived what he called the picture theory of
language – and it was this that was refined during the Austrian army’s
chaotic retreat under Russian attack. (p. 275)

------

He proved brave, asking to be assigned to the most dangerous place,
the observation post on the front line, which guaranteed he would be a
target. (p. 275)

------

He completed the book during a period of leave in 1918 after his uncle
Paul had bumped into him at a railway station where Wittgenstein was
contemplating suicide. The uncle persuaded his nephew to go with him
to Hallein, where he lived. (p. 276)

------

The argument of the book is that language corresponds to the world, as
a picture or model corresponds to the world that it attempts to
depict. (p. 277)

------

Frege, whose own work had inspired the Tractatus, died without ever
understanding it. (p. 277)

------

His major innovation was to realise that language has limitations,
that there are certain things it cannot do and that these have logical
and therefore philosophical consequences. (p. 277)

------

The same is true of philosophical generalisations that we make about
the world as a whole. They are meaningless if they cannot be broken
down into elementary sentences ‘which really are pictures.’ (p. 278)

------

Dadaists questioned whether, in the light of scientific and political
developments, art – in the broadest sense – was possible. They doubted
whether reality could be represented, arguing that it was too elusive,
according to science, and therefore dubious both morally and socially
If Dada valued anything, it was the freedom to experiment. (p. 280)

------

It was Richard Hülsenbeck who transported ‘the Dada virus’ to
Berlin. He published his Dada manifesto in April 1918, and a Dada club
was established. Early members included Raoul Hausmann, George Grosz,
John Heartfield, and Hannah Hoch, who replaced collage with
photomontage to attack the Prussian society that they all
loathed. (p. 282)

------

Unique to Paris Dada was automatic writing, a psychoanalytic technique
where the writer allowed himself to become ‘a recording machine,’
listening for the ‘unconscious murmur.’ André Breton thought that a
deeper level of reality could be realised through automatic writing,
‘that analogical sequences of thought’ were released in this way, and
he published a short essay in 1924 about the deeper meaning of our
conscious thoughts. (p. 284)

------

As commissar for education, an authority on music and theatre,
Lunacharsky had Lenin’s ear, and for a time several grandiose plans
were considered – for example, a proposal to erect at well-known
landmarks in Moscow a series of statues, monuments of great
international revolutionaries of the past. Loosely interpreted, many
of the ‘revolutionaries’ were French: Georges-Jacques Danton,
Jean-Paul Marat, Voltaire, Zola, Cézanne. (p. 286)

------

A new political category was needed: he put Prussianism and Socialism
together to come up with National Socialism. This would lead men to
exchange the ‘practical freedom’ of America and England for an ‘inner
freedom,’ ‘which comes through discharging obligations to the organic
whole.’ (p. 296)

------

What Joyce, Eliot, Lewis, and the others were criticising, among other
things, was the society – and not only the war society – which
capitalism had brought about, a society where value was placed on
possessions, where life had become a race to acquire things, as
opposed to knowledge, understanding, or virtue. (p. 319)

------

Under capitalism, he wrote, culture became more private, less was
shared, and this trend went against the common life of men –
individuality inevitably promoted inequality. (p. 320)

------

He got up at five every morning to write before going into the bank, a
routine so exhausting that in the autumn of 1921 he took a prolonged
leave. Pound’s poem Hugh Selwyn Mauberly, published the year before,
had a not dissimilar theme to The Waste Land. (p. 323)

------

Even stranger, the poem comes with notes and references, like an
academic paper. These notes, however, repay inspection. (p. 325)

------

Eliot, incidentally, did not share the vaguely Freudian view of most
people at the time (and since) that art was an expression of the
personality. On the contrary, for him it was ‘an escape from
personality.’ (p. 327)

------

Ulysses was also in part a response to the war – the last line reads:
‘Trieste-Zurich-Paris, 1914–1921.’ (p. 331)

------

For it is Joyce’s point that the age of heroes is over.* He loathed
the ‘heroic abstractions’ for which so many soldiers were sacrificed,
‘the big words which make us so unhappy.’ The odyssey of his
characters is not to negotiate the fearsome mythical world of the
Greeks – instead, he gives us Bloom’s entire day in Dublin on 16
June 1904. (p. 333)

------

‘If Ulysses isn’t fit to read’, said Joyce to his cousin, responding
to criticism, ‘life isn’t fit to live.’ (p. 334)

------

‘Whether these be sins or virtues old Nobodaddy will tell us at
doomsday (p. 334)

------

Sodome et Gomorrhe II was published in May 1922, the very month Proust
and Joyce met. Three more volumes – La Prisonnière, Albertine
disparue, and Le temps retrouvé — all came out after Proust died
in 1922. (p. 342)

------

Proust, who was himself homosexual, had suffered a double tragedy
during the war years when his driver and typist, Alfred Agostinelli,
with whom he had fallen in love, left him for a woman and went to live
in the south of France. (p. 343)

------

At the time of his death, Proust’s reputation was high. Now, however,
some critics argue that his achievement no longer merits the enormous
effort. For others, A la recherche du temps perdu is still one of the
outstanding achievements of modern literature, ‘the greatest
exploration of a self by anyone, including Freud.’ (p. 344)

------

Gide weaves these elements into a complex plot, which includes one
character, Edouard, who is writing a novel called The Counterfeiters,
and in which, in essence, everyone is a counterfeiter of
sorts. (p. 345)

------

The Counterfeiters is perhaps the most realistic diagnosis of our
times. The novel offers no prescription; it infers that none is really
available. If our predicament is ultimately tragic, why don’t more
people commit suicide? That too is a mystery. (p. 346)

------

Despite evidence that the longer immigrants were in the United States,
the better they performed on IQ tests, Brigham’s aim was to show that
the southern and eastern peoples of Europe, and Negroes, were of
inferior intelligence. (p. 354)

------

At one point, when Bryan insisted on testifying as an expert in
biblical science, he proved unwilling or unable to answer questions
about the age of the earth or of well-known archaeological sites. He
defended himself by saying, ‘I do not think about things I do not
think about.’ Darrow replied drily, ‘Do you think about things you do
think about?’ (p. 356)

------

Richard Hofstadter argues that particularly in the American South and
Midwest, people used the Christianity/evolution struggle as a cipher
for revolting against modernity.
