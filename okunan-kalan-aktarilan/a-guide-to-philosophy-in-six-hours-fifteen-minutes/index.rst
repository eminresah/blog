 This is one of the books that I've given up after a few pages. I
 thought I know everything it has and I didn't consider to go on just
 to rehash. The following are quotations from this not-so-fruitful
 experience.

------

A priorisynthetic judgments are possible in general and therefore in
transcendental aesthetics, because time and space are not a property
of things but rather a property of the subject. 
(p. 6)

------

Space does not come from an experience, but is the inevitable
condition of all experience. (p. 7)

------

Space is not a concept obtained by deduction. We cannot understand it
as concrete, because it is not an object. (p. 7)

------

The intuition of space is the inevitable condition of our a
priorisynthetic judgments, (p. 7)

------

We have demonstrated that Kant’s a priorisynthetic judgments are in
fact analytical judgments. (p. 7)

------

We do philosophy because we must. It is inevitable. Our consciousness
asks us questions and we must try to resolve them. (p. 7)

------

Kant demonstrates that only the co-relativity of subject and object
can form a reality. (p. 9)

------

Consciousness is not the brain, nor the body, because I am conscious
of my brain, but the brain cannot be conscious. (p. 10)

------

Kant wonders whether pure reason can discover the object in itself,
objectively, independently of our ways of perceiving it. (p. 14)

------

Our reason must be limited to the phenomenological world. (p. 14)
