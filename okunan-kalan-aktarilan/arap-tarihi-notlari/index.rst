Albert Hourani'nin *A History of the Arab Peoples* kitabını okuyorum.
Hz. Peygamber'in doğumundan başlayıp, modern zamanlara kadar Arap
tarihini anlatıyor. Hourani Lübnanlı bir Hristiyan aileden olduğu halde,
hemen hemen *İslam tarihi* demek olan bu hikayeyi gayet güzel bir dille
aktarıyor.

Ufak tefek notlar aldım, kitapta çizili olarak kalsınlar istemiyorum.
Tercüme edecek de zamanım yok, şimdilik aldığım haliyle kalacaklar.
Kalın vurgular benim, italik vurgular kitaptan.

    According to this estimate, by the end of the Umayyad perio (that is
    to say, in the middle years of the second Islamic and eighth
    Christian century) **less than 10 percent** of the population of
    Iran and Iraq, Syria and Egypt, Tunisia and Spain was Muslim,
    although the proportion must have been much greater in the Arabian
    peninsula. (p. 46)

    By the end of fourth Islamic century [...] the picture had changed.
    A large part of the population had become Muslim. Not only the
    townspeople, but a considerable number of the rural people had
    converted. One reason for this may have been that Islam had become
    more clearly defined, and the line between Muslims and non Muslims
    more sharply drawn. (p. 47)

    Arab tribe of *Banu Kalb* (p. 51)

    al-Biruni['s ...] \\\ :sub:`Tahqiq` ma li'l-Hind (History of India)
    is perhaps the greatest sustained attempt by a Muslim writer to go
    beyond the world of Islam and appropriate what was of value in
    another cultural tradition. His work is not a polemic, as he himself
    makes clear in his foreword:

        This is not a book of controversy and debate, putting forward
        the arguments of an opponent and distinguishing what is false in
        them from what is true. It is a straightforward account, giving
        the statements of Hindus and adding to them what the Greeks have
        said of similar subjects, so as to make a comparison between
        them.

    Indian religious and philosophical though is depicted at its best.

        Since we are describing what there is in India, we mention their
        superstitions, but we should point out that these are matter for
        the common people only. Those who follow the way of salvation or
        the path of reason and argument, and who want the truth, would
        avoid worshipping anyone except God alone, or any graven image
        of him. [...] The Indians in our time make numerous distinctions
        among human beings. We differ from them in this, for we regard
        all men as equal except in piety. This is the greatest barrier
        between them and Islam. (p. 54)

    [Sunnis] came to accept all four of the first caliphs asn
    legitimate, and as virtuous or rightly guided (*rashidun*); later
    caliphs might not always have acted justly, but they should be
    accepted as legitimate so long as they did not go against the basic
    commandments of God. [...] It was widely accepted that [caliph]
    should be descended from the tribe of Quraysh, to which the Prophet
    had belonged. (p. 61)

    Since the world could not exist without an *imam*, it was believed
    [by Shiis] that the twelfth one had not died but was still living,
    in occlusion. (*ghayba*). (p.61)

    [Ibn Hanbal says] if the Qur'an ascribes attributes to Him, they
    must be accepted as divide attributes, not on the analogy of human
    ones and without asking how they inhere in Him. (p. 64)

    al-Ashari (d. 935) held to the literal interpretation of the Qur'an,
    by maintained that it could be justified by reason, at least up to a
    certain point, and beyond that point it must simply be accepted. God
    was One; His attributes were part of His essence ; they were not
    God, but they were not other than God. (p. 65)

    In Ash'ari's though there is an emphasis on the imprtance of not
    quarrelling in religion and also of accepting the rule of the *imam*
    or caliph and not revolting against it with the sword. (p. 65)

    [About *sunna* of the prophet and the community:] At first the
    *sunna* of the community had been the more important of the two. (p.
    70)

    Ibn Abi Usaybi'a reproduced in full the Hippocratic oath of Greek
    doctors, 'I swear by God, Lord of life and death ... and I swear by
    Asclepius, and I swear by all the saints of God ...' (p. 77)

    [On philosophy and religion] Abu Bakr al-Razi (865-925) answered
    such questions in an unequivocal way. Human reason alone could give
    certain knowledge, the path of philosophy was open to all uses, the
    claims of revelation were false and religions were dangerous. (p.
    78)
