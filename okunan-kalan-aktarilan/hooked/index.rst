Theoretically (means that *I didn't apply but*) this book tells how to
build products that make people hooked into using it. Like social
media software which makes people to addict in some ways. There are a
few good ideas, though, as I said, I don't know if I can ever find
ways to apply them. 

------

[T]he framework and practices explored in this book are not
one-size-fits-all and do not apply to every business or industry. (p. 13)

------

companies selling infrequently bought or used products or services do
not require habitual users — at least, not in the sense of everyday
engagement. (p. 14)

------

“You can determine the strength of a business over time by the amount
of agony they go through in raising prices.” (p. 15)

------

as customers form routines around a product, they come to depend upon
it and become less price-sensitive. (p. 15)

------

users also increase their dependency on habit-forming products by
storing value in them — further reducing the likelihood of switching
to an alternative. For (p. 19)

------

A 2010 study found that some habits can be formed in a matter of weeks
while others can take more than five months. (p. 24)

------

Before making up your mind on the vitamin or painkiller debate for
some of the world’s most successful tech companies, consider this
idea: A habit is when not doing an action causes a bit of pain. (p. 26)

------

External triggers are embedded with information, which tells the user
what to do next. (p. 30)

------

More choices require the user to evaluate multiple options. Too many
choices or irrelevant options can cause hesitation, confusion, or
worse, abandonment. (p. 31)

------

for most business models, companies generally use paid triggers to
acquire new users and then leverage other triggers to bring them
back. (p. 32)

------

Owned triggers are only set after users sign up for an account, submit
their email address, install an app, opt into newsletters, or
otherwise indicate they want to continue receiving
communications. (p. 33)

------

through the Hook Model so that, after successive cycles, they do not
need further prompting from external triggers. (p. 33)

------

Users who find a product that alleviates their pain will form strong,
positive associations with the product over time. (p. 35)
