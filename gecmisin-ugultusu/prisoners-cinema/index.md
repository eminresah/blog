> The Prisoner’s Cinema is a phenomenon reported by prisoners confined
> to dark cells and by others kept in darkness, voluntarily or not, for
> long periods of time. The “cinema” consists of a “light show” of
> various colors that appear out of the darkness. The light has a form,
> but those that have seen it find it difficult to describe. Sometimes,
> the cinema lights resolve into human or other figures. (via
