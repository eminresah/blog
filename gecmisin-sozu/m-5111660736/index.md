> Blissymbols or Blissymbolics were conceived of as an ideographic
> writing system consisting of several hundred basic symbols, each
> representing a concept, which can be composed together to generate new
> symbols that represent new concepts. Blissymbols differ from most of
> the worldâ€™s major writing systems in that the characters do not
> correspond at all to the sounds of any spoken language. In this it is
> like other similar constructed languages such as Zlango, Isotype, or
> Characteristica universalis. (via
