  The idea that biological crimes can be ended by intellect alone, that
  you can talk crime to death, doesn't work. Intellectual patterns cannot
  directly control biological patterns. Only social patterns control
  biological patterns and the instrument of conversation between society
  and biology is not words. (p. 355)
