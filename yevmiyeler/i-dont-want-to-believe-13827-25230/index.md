I don't want to believe. I don't want to believe that's all. I don't want to
believe that we have no *real* purpose. I don't want to believe that my birth
and death has no significance excepting a close circle of other mortals. I don't
want to believe that I don't have to believe. 

I read the post I've quoted in March 2017. It is about different views of *God*.
Humanity evolves and its *gods* too. Where we arrive, however, denouncing *God*
and laughing all the way to the beginning of history about the idea of *God.*

The insignificant man also evolves, his ideas, his gods, his ghosts. It's almost
impossible not to evolve today, we are continuously under flood of different
information and opinions. One has to lock himself to the basement with the
religious books written a thousand years ago not to evolve.

Some people may do this but I cannot. Could not. I cannot stop my views on God
to change. Although not an Atheist, I'm moving towards a more abstract version.
I don't know what will I think next, (can you?), but from the journey I took,
it's obvious that I'm not becoming more religious. 

The insignificant man has his crises. He will find God, maybe, or himself.
