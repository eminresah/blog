My answer to that question is *no, it won't.* Actually democracy is already
dead, people are opting to their small benefits over abstract principles.
Democracy was an interim value, that was produced by the decentralized wealth.
It looks as the wealthy learn to feed the people's mind to cause the intended
behavior, democracy becomes synonymous to *plutocracy.*

It wasn't some sacred value anyway. Would you be slave of a wealthy man or a
poor peasant? Although our current values say otherwise, being slave was a
*status* for some (or most) people in the history. Our understanding of human
behavior was flawed, so our social and political theories and we roll our eyes
when we see that people select gadgets and toys over democracy. Yes, they do, as
they always did.
