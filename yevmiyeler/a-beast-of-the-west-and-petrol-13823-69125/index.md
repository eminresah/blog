When you look at Muslim history, you can see a trend for modernization in 19th
century. Ottomans were changing their attitude to religion and modern world,
other places were also following the trend.

In 20th century, however, came a backlash and a **return to primary sources**
movement. This was mostly funded by Arab Wahhabi kings of Arabia. Their vision
about the religion was not **organic**, they were not believing any change of
beliefs due to historical situation, they were considering themselves **Salafi**
that is **immediate followers of the Prophet.** Although Turkey was mostly secured
from their ideology, currently when you say **Sunni Islam** it's mostly understood
in terms of these people, unlike a century ago where the Sunni Caliph could also
be a painter or a composer. (Can you even imagine Saudi King to be a painter of
some kind? The last Ottoman Caliph was.)

In 1916, when the Sharif of Mecca agreed with the English to follow a course of
independence for an **Arab Kingdom**, their ideological arsenal against the
Ottoman Sultan was Wahhabism. This ideology was used to incite a revolt against
Ottomans, because they need some religious justification to revolt against the
Caliph and blaming his deeds from a point taking its source from *infallible
book* was the most guaranteed. This was indirectly supported by the British at
that time and flourished since then. Their insistence **to return to basics** is
just a big anachronistic lie. You can't reverse the time and become an immediate
successor to the Prophet, but you can use his name and Islam's basic sources to
rally people around you. The basic reasoning of **radical Islam** is this:
**Allah said this, Allah said that, anyone who doesn't accept this is an infidel
and his blood is permitted.** When traditional ideology lost power and appeal,
people turned into such **snake oil ideologies** that claim to cure all disease
in the Islamic world. The current **terrorism** is a natural result of this.
Because of this snake oil ideology of *ignoring history and accepting the book
as our only saviour*, we are sicker than ever.

When you consider yourself an immediate successor to somebody, despite 1400
years in between, you strive to transform the world into a world that you can
really be a successor. It's not possible, though understanding that it's not
possible and Allah didn't set all rules in the Book or the Prophet's Sunna is
not always applicable, takes time and much blood.

I hope Muslims are understanding that our problems are not that easy. You can't
solve them with an **infallible book.** Our attitude is primarily a showcase for
brain laziness. Instead of thinking real solutions to real problems, it's much
easier to **turn to the book** and agitate. I don't know where this agitation
will lead us but I'm always optimistic that we'll have some major shifts in
Islamic thought when petroleum stops funding this easy-cheesy ideology.
