The weird feeling when you read/listen about mindfulness while eating.

This is world of show. Being mindful is no show. It doesn't bring you more show,
more wealth or more anything. It is just it is.

However it becomes like a fun activity to talk about it, how it heals, how it
feels, how it makes people stronger, how it evaporates all the tiredness the day
brings. Does it? Maybe.

When mindfulness becomes mainstream, will we be able to be mindful about
ourselves, always? Probably no. Being mainstream is against mindfulness. Being
mainstream is chatter. The bazaar.

Talking and listening about it and finding value in the void of the life is
important, I see, but that weird feeling like you're watching some kind of porn
is still there. I don't want to know how people becomes mindful, I want to be.
