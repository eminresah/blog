Sometimes the world forgets you, sometimes you forget the world. 

The latter happens to me more frequently, because the *premise* of the first is
never complete. The world seems not to forget me, it didn't learn in the first
place.

Did I felt a shock when I learned the body that controls Internet communications
turned off Wikipedia? Turkish government is the master of shooting their leg and
showing this off when it comes to communication. Hah, an epic act that caused
even the *Deaf Sultan of Egypt* to hear the words about Turkish/ISIS
relationship. If this blind bureaucrats had rent billboards over all Europe to
advertise this sentence, I doubt it would be more effective. 

Sometimes I would like to think that there are hidden causes, hidden agendas
behind such actions. The government is acting so foolishly that it becomes
difficult to believe it. But in this case, no, I really can't find a good
*reason* to turn this around. 

The optimistic side in this story is this: When people are afraid of a Sauron-like
Erdogan, they forget how incompetent his allies and bureaucracy are. Not that
they want to limit personal freedoms to an ancient level but they don't have
means and capacity for this. You cannot dress a Hitler to Erdoğan's body, not
enough equipment for it.
