*Intelligence* means different ideas in different contexts. When someone uses
the word for human, we more or less know what it means. If someone is able to
understand the environment and act to maximize their benefits, it looks like an
intelligent act for us.

For robots though, this line of reasoning is misleading. When someone speaks
about *superintelligence*, they don't claim an artificial mind will surpass
humans in humans' goals. It may or it may not, it's not relevant. 

The real threat of superintelligence is not that it will be *somebody* that we
can go and manipulate. We can lie to our *digital assistants* now, we can tell
them we want to drive to a museum but instead our intention to see someone in
the bar next to it. The naive robot will kindly show the way for us. How clever
we didn't record that we're meeting with someone...

However this kind of interaction will leave to *automated interaction* as the
time passes. Computers will be able to understand what we need, maybe checking
our communication with one another, maybe doing quick blood tests, maybe reading
signals of our brain... They will know what we are up to before us and lead us
to there. It will be much easier that our current modus operandi. No need to
talk, to tell, to instruct. The device in our pockets already knows to maximize
our happiness (and maybe *utility*) to the society, we just obey to its
instructions and enjoy the life. 

Our current society looks like a bunch of rocks, which try to fit together. We
are all hitting and pushing into each other, we are all trying to reach to the
top by stepping on to others. What superintelligence will provide is a mortar to
connect us to the rest. Our current society will look like a band of hunter
gatherers when it will arrive. 

In such a society there won't be lies, because there won't be any need to lie.
Why do lie if your true desires are all opaque to the machine in your pocket and
it knows how to reach it the fastest? And why do you need to think a rebellion
against such an intelligence?
