Looking inward what do you see?

I don't see much, it's the same darkness. I can't see anything that I can't see
outside as well. All my inner reflections seem to be based on my outer
experience.

That shouldn't be right, you have to find some guidance in your inner world, at
least that's what is said by others.

Do you think it's possible for a human to think outside of the experience he
has? We build out thoughts from that experience. That's the fabric, right?

Ah, the old rationalist/empiricist dialogue.

Yes, maybe, though I said *fabric* and mind is the scissors that's applied on
this fabric. So when some person defends rationalism, we point to the fabric, when
a person lauds empiricism, we point to the scissors.

Scissors and fabric philosophy, you say. Both are required or what? Which one is
the basic?

Neither of them, or both of them. Our problem in determining the source of
thoughts is that this investigation is always *post-hoc.* We have some thoughts,
some mental state and we are trying to come up with an explanation. This
explanation has to take one of these aspect *primary* as it's a linear
explanation. You can't say *both* otherwise you're accused of being vague.
However when you look for the primary cause, you can find both of them, or any
mixture of them as the primary cause.

So there isn't a primary cause, or both?

The reason we are looking a primary cause is *political* I think. It's mostly
about thinking a *leader* or a *king.* We are trying to find a ruler for our
mind, are we citizens of nature as an empiricist may claim or a subjects of
mind?

Nowadays everything is political, so there is no surprise that you reduce this
debate to a political one.
