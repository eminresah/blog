When I read Physics, the early stages of the universe, I *desire* to believe that there was *somebody* knowing all these facts. An observer, maybe, even not a creator. I need this because I want to believe that ultimately these are *knowable* facts and we are not that lost. 

It may or may not be possible to relate this observer with a religion or attribute the observer more powers than *observing.* But ultimately as we want to know, we need to believe that there was somebody who could tell this. 

It may be childish. Maybe just so. However if we want to attribute a meaning to the universe, somebody like this seems essential to me. Saying all these trees fall in an empty forest and there is no way to decide how it happened is too much for me to bear.
