> «It is more nearly possible, however, for the public to enlighten itself; indeed, if it is only given freedom, enlightenment is almost inevitable. There will always be a few independent thinkers, even among the self-appointed guardians of the multitude.» -- [Kant. What is Enlightenment](https://ift.tt/1pwjxY7)

Is this really the case wonders one. If we give a chance to people for _enlightenment_, do they really become so?

Do they prefer it over social media or celebrity gossip?

The _model_ for human in these philosophers and thinkers look lame to me. Man is foremost an animal. It has to satisfy basic needs like hunger and sex before _higher desires_ like enlightenment. More so my experience with people shows that they abuse _higher desires_ for _lower_ ones, like power and basic needs. 

So when someone speaks about enlightment, it mostly reminds me of concealed _lower desires._ Instead of speaking and _solving_ them directly, we abuse concepts like enlightenment and even propose that people will become enlightened if given chance. 

No they won’t. Enlightenment is easy. The problem is actually feeding those _lower desires._
