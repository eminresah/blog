[Son maçı 2 ay önce yapmışım](/yeni/1-kitap-turnuvasi-2-tur-7-mac-21413) ve o zaman niyetim her gün
en az bir kitap maçı yapmaktı. Bu arada 2 ev taşındı, çocuklar 3 defa birer hafta benimle kaldı ve
aralarda turnuvadaki iki kitabı *herkesin yaptığı şekilde* okudum. Bu arada turnuva da her gün
aklımdaydı ve ara ara 2. turnuva için rastgele kitap topluyordumama sanırım bu turnuvaların ilk ve
ikinci turlarını twitter
üzerinden yapmak daha iyi olacak. Hatta kazananı belirlemek için anket de yapabilirim. 

Bu maçta bir tarafta Sandman çizgi romanının 2. fasikülü var, diğer tarafta Richard Koch'un *The
80-20 Principle* kitabı. 15 dakika sürede Sandman'i bitirince diğeri otomatik olarak üst tura yükselmiş oldu ama onu da okudum. 

# The Sandman - Number 2 - February 1989

[Sandman][sandman] yazarlığını Neil Gaiman'ın yaptığı Ocak 89'dan Mart 96'ya kadar çıkmış bir çizgi
roman. Hikayeyi anlatmayayım ama güzel görünüyor. Hikayenin başka adaptasyonları da varmış.
[Netflix][netflix] de bir dizi haline getiriyor. 

Buraya sadece bir ekran görüntüsü bırakayım.

# The 80-20 Principle

![the-80-20-principle](/images/book-covers/the-80-20-principle-cover.png)

Bu kitap *Pareto Prensibi* adıyla da bilinen konu anlatılıyor. İlk defa *İngiltere'de arazilerin
%80'i insanların %20'sine aittir* diye gözlenmiş. Sonra Zipf dağılımı adıyla yeniden gözlenmiş ve
farklı alanlarda önemlilik, meşguliyet, kar veya verimlilik değerlendirmeleri için kullanılan bir prensip. Bir işletmenin karının %80'i, müşterilerinin %20'sinden gelir diyor mesela.

The reason that the 80/20 Principle is so valuable is that it is
counterintuitive. We tend to expect that all causes will have roughly the
same significance. That all customers are equally valuable. That every bit of
business, every product and every dollar of sales revenue is as good as
another. That all employees in a particular category have roughly equivalent
value. That each day or week or year we spend has the same significance.
That all our friends have roughly equal value to us. That all enquiries or
phone calls should be treated in the same way. That one university is as
good as another. That all problems have a large number of causes, so that it
is not worth isolating a few key causes. That all opportunities are of roughly
equal value, so that we treat them all equally.

In 1963, IBM discovered that about 80 per cent of a computer’s time is
spent executing about 20 per cent of the operating code. The company
immediately rewrote its operating software to make the most used 20 per
cent very accessible and user friendly, thus making IBM computers more
efficient and faster than competitors’ machines for the majority of
applications.

He happened to be looking at
patterns of wealth and income in nineteenth-century England. He found that
most income and wealth went to a minority of the people in his samples.
Perhaps there was nothing very surprising in this. But he also discovered
two other facts that he thought highly significant. One was that there was a
consistent mathematical relationship between the proportion of people (as a
percentage of the total relevant population) and the amount of income or
wealth that this group enjoyed. 4 To simplify, if 20 per cent of the population
enjoyed 80 per cent of the wealth, 5 then you could reliably predict that 10
per cent would have, say, 65 per cent of the wealth, and 5 per cent would
have 50 per cent. The key point is not the percentages, but the fact that the
distribution of wealth across the population was predictably unbalanced.He happened to be looking at

The pattern underlying the 80/20 Principle was discovered in 1897, exactly
100 years ago, by Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto (1848–1923). His
discovery has since been called many names, including the Pareto Principle,
the Pareto Law, the 80/20 Rule, the Principle of Least Effort and the
Principle of Imbalance; throughout this book we will call it the 80/20
Principle.
