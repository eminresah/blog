In February, I was in depression. The project I'm involved wasn't moving and I
was having marital problems and some health problems on top of it. In that
period I stumbled upon *Inbox Zero* Merlin Mann's [essay titled
Cranking.](http://www.43folders.com/2011/04/22/cranking)

It resonated deeply. Firstly I'm one of those who lost their father early. Mann
was 7, I was 5. I also have a daughter that age and a son, so I understand what his
father feels to his *big guy*.

In that essay he says: 

> But, that part’s gone missing for just a little too long now. Certainly not
> missing from my handsome and very practical rhetoric—it’s been missing from my
> actual life and living. In a quest to make something that has increasingly not
> felt like my own, I’ve unintentionally ignored my own counsel to never let your
> hard work fuck up the good things. Including those regular people. Including,
> ironically, the real work. Including any good thing the crank is supposed to be
> attached to. So, I’m done fucking that up. I’m done cranking. And, I’m ready to
> make a change.

Am I ready to make a change? 
    
This question still persists for 3 months. I've decided to finish the project as much as possible. It's not the first and probably won't be the last one I've failed. I don't know what will happen to TTCM. I'm trying to reduce the number of variables in my life and it looks we have reached the limit. 

Then what will happen? I will have more time to write, maybe. Maybe we can play more with my daughter and make (real!) swords with my son.
