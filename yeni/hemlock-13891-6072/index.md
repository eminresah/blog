> It used to be thought that death by hemlock was painful and ugly, with spasms,
> choking and vomiting; but we now know, thanks to classicist and amateur
> toxicologist Enid Bloch, that the particular species of hemlock used for this
> purpose in ancient Athens (Conium maculatum, available on the slopes of nearby
> Hymettus) was effective, but not especially violent. Its effects, in fact, are
> pretty much as Plato described them in the closing pages of his dialogue Phaedo,
> a beautiful and profound work set in prison on the last day of Socratesâ€™ life.
> Plato correctly portrays his beloved mentor dying a gradual death by paralysis,
> leading finally to asphyxiation. His body was then collected by family and
> friends and accorded the traditional rites.
