Are all lies equal? 

Once you see that the language is not capable to carry
the weight of *the truth*, it's meaningless to depend on the language for more than daily
activities. The *higher* kind of communication is usually becomes a tribal dance: We tell the
stories that our tribe wants to hear with the words we have devised for this very purpose. Also
known as social science. 

However all lies are not equal. There are coherent lies, incoherent lies, lies that
lead to action, lies that lead to inaction, lies that lead to truth, lies that
lead to more lies.

Even if I don't believe that language is capable to produce a properly true
sentence I can look for *better lies.* A coherent lie is better than an incoherent one and a lie
that leads to *good action* is better than *good inaction* which is better than *bad action.* 

Hence we create levels of lies. It doesn't matter whether a model of the world or a tribal custom
leads to truth. It matters only whether this model is beneficial for our metaphysics.
