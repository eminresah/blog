This is probably why I like to write tweets and writing makes me feel happy,
whatever I write at the end.

My mind wanders. If I write them down, it’s a success and I see them on the page
for a moment. They may not be interesting for others but most of them are
entertaining for me.

Maybe I should simply stop trying to cease my wandering mind and cultivate it to
bring me more interesting thoughts.
