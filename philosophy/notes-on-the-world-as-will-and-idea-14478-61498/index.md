> So then the world as idea, the only aspect in which [pg 006] we consider it at
> present, has two fundamental, necessary, and inseparable halves. The one half is
> the object, the forms of which are space and time, and through these
> multiplicity. The other half is the subject, which is not in space and time, for
> it is present, entire and undivided, in every percipient being.

### page 30 

> But the law of causation receives its meaning and necessity only from this, that
> the essence of change does not consist simply in the mere variation of things,
> but rather in the fact that at the same part of space there is now one thing and
> then another, and at one and the same point of time there is here one thing and
> there another: only this reciprocal limitation of space and time by each other
> gives meaning, and at the same time necessity, to a law, according to which
> change must take place. What is determined by the law of causality is therefore
> not merely a succession of things in time, but this succession with reference to
> a definite space, and not merely existence of things in a particular place, but
> in this place at a different point of time.
