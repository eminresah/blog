It’s much better to read the best book on the topic 5 times, than to read 5 different books on the topic once. Eyes that pay read better than eyes that don’t. Eyes that pay more read better than eyes that pay less. In other words, when you pay for a book or a course, you’ll dedicate more to it, so you’ll get more value from it. Good books can offer you a lot of great ideas and useful knowledge. You can’t apply or adopt all of it in your life. Focusing on 3 ideas from which you can benefit in a near future is the best thing you can do. If you read ~1h (almost) every day, you’ll be able to read 60-80 books per year. When you read a lot, you’ll forget a lot. Make notes about the most important ideas and knowledge you get from books you’ve read.
