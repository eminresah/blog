Treat yourself well. Prioritize your whole self and your overall well-being; you are more than what you do in your course, in your team, or in your organization. Recognize and quell internal monologues of failure or less than optimal performance. Don’t get into unhealthy competition with yourself. Laugh at yourself with compassion. Allow yourself to brag about your successes, and don’t take anyone who teases you about it seriously.

Note your cultural programming—are you really feeling like an impostor, or are you afraid to admit you’re good at what you do for fear of being called arrogant? Look for personal cultural differences around bragging, self-promotion, competition, and contribution, including taking responsibility for an honest audit of your own cultural or personal biases. Don’t introduce unhealthy competition into your teams, whether you are a manager or a peer. Introduce play and playfulness into the work world. Know that in 95 percent of situations, you’re part of a bigger social system and you don’t have to do it all. Nor are you responsible for it all. Learn to recognize the traits of toxic settings, situations, and organizations, and if you can’t institute or effect change, leave.
