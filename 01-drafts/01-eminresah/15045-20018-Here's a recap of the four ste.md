Here's a recap of the four steps of NVC:

Observe Facts - observe the specific facts that are affecting our wellbeing, and bring them up with the other person

Note Feelings - introspect about what exactly we are feeling in response to what we've observed, and communicate these feelings

Uncover Desires - figure out the desires, wants and values that are creating our feelings, and explain them to the other person

Make Requests - ask for concrete actions to help resolve the situation
