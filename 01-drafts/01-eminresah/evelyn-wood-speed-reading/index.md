Notes
=====

Mental Soaring:

You must learn to see and accept the words and phrases out of their
normal expectancy order.

Accept visual, as opposed to auditory, reassurance as you read

Learn to read vertically

Understand the gestalt fo what you read

There are five comprehension levels: (1) Preview (2) 2 sec/page (3) 4
sec/page (4) slightly faster than comfort (5) fast and comfortable.
Comprehension rates are (1) 10% (2) 20% (3) 40-60% (4) 60-80% (5) 80%

Evelyn discovered the hand-motion concept as she was brushing dirt off a
book that she had tossed down on the ground. In cleaning off each page,
she began to read simultaneously at supersonic speeds \-- and thus the
Wood hand-motion concept was born.

Hand movements: establish rhythm for eye movements. enhance
concentration. prevent regression.

There is line by line hand movement. S hand movement. In both of these,
4 fingers are used. The question mark (?), the X, the L, the loop, the
horseshoe, the U, the brush and the half-moon.

Recall patterns: Similar to mind maps. (But this book is older than
them.)

Supersonic writing
==================

Establish a point of view
-------------------------

Identify specific research material
-----------------------------------

compile all information
-----------------------

Reorganize information into One Master Recall Pattern
-----------------------------------------------------

Write the first draft
---------------------

Prepare the final draft
-----------------------

How fast can you write? The above method requires 35-45 hours for a 5000 word term homework.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You need to make drills and read a lot to keep higher speeds. It\'s
possible to achieve 5000 wpm but it\'s harder to keep it.

Without practice everything decays.

Pre-exam principles
===================

Avoid cramming
--------------

Manage anxiety
--------------

Operate at the test site as you have been studying
--------------------------------------------------

Overview
--------

Read all instructions closely
-----------------------------

Select appropriate technique
----------------------------

You know, you have to practice that hand motion and that layering. It may take only a few minutes to learn a technique but to master and maintain it demans regular attention.
