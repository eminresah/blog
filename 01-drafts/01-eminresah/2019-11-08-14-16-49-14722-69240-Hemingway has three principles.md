Hemingway has three principles about his writing work. 

*Great ending, great session - feeling good about one's work*

The first brilliant thing he did was stopping at a high point. Many procrastinators that actually get to working on something stop once they're mentally exhausted or only once they find a problem too hard to solve.

That means they have to start at that hard place the next day, which means more trepidation.

By stopping at an interesting point, a point where he knew how the story would go, he removed this trepidation and anticipation of problems and substituted it with curiosity and joy.

*Starting by reviewing = mental warm up*

The rewrite what you wrote yesterday rule is another key trepidation remover.

By first reading and then editing what he wrote, Hemingway got into the right head space that naturally lead to writing the next thing.

Having a relatively easy "on-ramp" activity is smart.

*Not expecting perfection from the start*

The last of these three tips is also critical.Perhaps due to many movies depicting brilliant writing sessions or social media only showing the end result, many people have a picture of a creative session where great ideas just fall out of the sky.
