God's primary use is to continue speaking even if the things you can say is
finished. It fills the void, not of the universal, material void but a void of
meaning. It is the soul of universe in this sense. God Almighty is able to
create meaning out of void and able to destroy meaning as well.

Thus, for a believer, existence of God is real as any other meaningful thing. It
signifies everything, as it's far beyond anything we can compare.
